**Report for Object: o_workstation_1**

On April 4, 2023, several significant events occurred at workstation o_workstation_1.

1. At **12:22:52 UTC**, a heating process was conducted for a steel sheet with ID **o_steelsheet_2777**, weighing **0.02137 kg**, using machine **o_machine_oven01**. The heating lasted for **900 seconds**, resulting in a CO2 emission of **0.0138019093344 kg**. The process consumed **0.02 kWh** of electric energy and included a gas input of **0.49392 Wh**, which also matched the burn emissions measured.

2. Shortly thereafter, at **12:23:23 UTC**, the same workstation utilized a splitter machine identified as **Machine[splitter01]** to split a steel sheet. This operation lasted approximately **14.34 seconds**, generating a **0.015 kg** CO2 equivalent emission. The steel sheet processed weighed **0.02114 kg** and had been created from **SteelCoil[3]**, which weighed **31.91076 kg**. The electric energy consumption for this operation was **0.021915 kWh**, with a negligible production of **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling.

3. At **12:24:05 UTC**, the workstation split another steel sheet, identified as **o_steelsheet_2786**, weighing **0.02124 kg**, from the same steel coil, **o_steelcoil_3**. This splitting process, performed by machine **o_machine_splitter01**, lasted **13.9505415346 seconds**, with CO2 emissions totaling **0.014587239 kg**. The energy consumed was **0.0213133 kWh**, and a minimal **0.00042 kg** of steel waste was created for recycling.

4. Following this, at **12:26:15 UTC**, another splitting operation utilizing the splitter machine took place, processing **SteelCoil[3]** to create a new steel sheet, identified as **SteelSheet[2795]**, weighing **0.02086 kg**. This operation lasted approximately **14.73 seconds**, generating CO2 emissions of **0.0154 kg** and producing **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling, with an energy consumption of **0.0225 kWh** from the grid.

5. Finally, at **12:31:15 UTC**, heat was applied to a steel sheet identified as **o_steelsheet_2812** at the workstation using machine **o_machine_oven01**. This heating lasted **900 seconds**, consuming **0.02 kWh** of electricity, alongside **0.49392 Wh** of gas input, producing CO2 emissions of **0.0138019093344 kg**.

These events signify a continuous process of heating and splitting steel sheets while efficiently utilizing resources at o_workstation_1 throughout the specified timeline.
