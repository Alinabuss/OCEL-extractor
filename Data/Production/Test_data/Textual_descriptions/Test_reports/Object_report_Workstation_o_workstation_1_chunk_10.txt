### Combined Report for Object o_workstation_1

On April 3, 2023, at 10:37:41 UTC, a heating process was conducted at workstation o_workstation_1, which is equipped with machine o_machine_oven01. This operation involved a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[853], weighing 0.02125 kg, and lasted for 900 seconds. It resulted in emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent, with an energy consumption of 0.02 kWh sourced from the electric grid. The gas input utilized during this process was 0.49392 Wh, corresponding to the same amount of emissions due to burning.

Shortly after, at 10:40:00 UTC, another heating process was performed on a steel sheet identified as o_steelsheet_863, having a mass of 0.02143 kg. This process also lasted for 900 seconds and occurred at the same workstation, utilizing the same machine. It generated emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2, with identical energy consumption and gas input as the previous operation.

At 10:45:24 UTC, a third operation took place on a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[886], weighing 0.02119 kg. This heating process continued for 900 seconds at workstation o_workstation_1, using machine o_machine_oven01. CO2 emissions recorded were again 0.0138019093344 kg, with energy consumption from the grid noted at 0.02 kWh and gas input of 0.49392 Wh.

Minutes later, at 10:45:53 UTC, another heating event was conducted on a steel sheet identified as o_steelsheet_888, which had a mass of 0.02108 kg. This operation mirrored the previous ones in duration (900 seconds) and occurred at workstation o_workstation_1 with machine o_machine_oven01. Emissions were recorded at 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2, and energy consumption remained consistent at 0.02 kWh alongside gas input and emissions of 0.49392 Wh.

Finally, at 10:46:49 UTC, the last heating process on April 3 was performed on a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_892, using the same machine at workstation o_workstation_1. Carrying on the pattern, this operation lasted for 900 seconds and resulted in emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2e, with energy consumed from the grid recorded at 0.02 kWh and gas input remaining at 0.49392 Wh. 

Throughout all events, the heating processes have consistently resulted in emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent, a 900-second duration, and identical energy consumption metrics, demonstrating a stable operational profile at workstation o_workstation_1.
