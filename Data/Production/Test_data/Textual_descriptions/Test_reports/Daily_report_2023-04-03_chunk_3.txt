On April 3, 2023, a series of events occurred primarily at Workstation ID o_workstation_1, utilizing Machine ID o_machine_former02 for the transformation of steel sheets into formed parts.

The first event took place at 08:32:31 UTC, where the workstation processed a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_259, weighing 0.02133 kg, transforming it into a formed part identified as o_formedpart_259. This process lasted 5 seconds, during which it emitted 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 equivalent and consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electricity from the grid.

Shortly after, at 08:37:18 UTC, another transformation occurred at the same workstation, where SteelSheet ID o_steelsheet_277, weighing 0.02117 kg, was formed into a part designated as o_formedpart_277. This process also took 5 seconds, emitted 0.0028500228 kg of CO2, and consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electric energy from the grid, utilizing the same machine, o_machine_former02.

At 08:48:09 UTC, a steel sheet with an input mass of 0.02118 kg was again processed at Workstation ID o_workstation_1, using Machine ID o_machine_former02. The forming process took 5 seconds, resulted in a CO2 emissions output of 0.0028500228 kg, and consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electricity from the grid, with the outcome being a formed part linked to the input steel sheet.

Just moments later, at 08:48:19 UTC, the same machine was used once again at the same workstation to transform another steel sheet weighing 0.02126 kg into a formed part. This operation lasted 5.0 seconds, with similar emissions and energy consumption outputs as previous processes.

Finally, at 08:59:35 UTC, another forming operation took place at Workstation ID o_workstation_1, involving SteelSheet ID o_steelsheet_374 with a mass of 0.02116 kg, which was transformed into FormedPart ID o_formedpart_374. This process also lasted 5 seconds, emitted 0.0028500228 kg of CO2, and consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electric energy from the grid. 

Throughout April 3, 2023, all operations were consistently carried out with efficiency at Workstation ID o_workstation_1, confirming the effectiveness of Machine ID o_machine_former02 in handling the steel forming tasks.
