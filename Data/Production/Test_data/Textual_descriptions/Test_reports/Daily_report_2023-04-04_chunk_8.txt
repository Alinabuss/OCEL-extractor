On April 4, 2023, several significant events took place, primarily involving the cutting and forming of various parts at Workstation[2] and other workstations.

At 11:34:33 UTC, a male part with ID MalePart[2019] was cut using Machine[101]. This process lasted 9.92 seconds, resulting in a CO2 equivalent emission of 0.077 kg. During the operation, the machine consumed 0.015 kWh of electricity, utilized 0.082 m³ of compressed air, and employed 0.061 m³ of nitrogen gas, which was also emitted to the air in the same volume. The input for this operation was a formed part identified as FormedPart[2019].

Shortly after, at 11:54:31 UTC, another male part, this time with ID MalePart[2332], was cut at Workstation[2] using Machine[cutter01]. This process took approximately 9.96 seconds, generating CO2 emissions of 0.0697 kg. The machine consumed 0.0152 kWh of electricity, utilized 0.064 m³ of compressed air, and employed 0.061 m³ of nitrogen gas, which was also released into the atmosphere. This part was produced from a formed part identified as FormedPart[2332].

At 11:54:55 UTC, a workstation with ID o_workstation_1 was employed to form a steel sheet identified as o_steelsheet_2592, which had a mass of 0.02114 kg. The forming process lasted 5 seconds and emitted 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 equivalent. The operation utilized o_machine_former02, which consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electricity sourced from the grid, resulting in the creation of a formed part with ID o_formedpart_2592 from the steel sheet.

Just moments later, at 11:55:04 UTC, Machine[cutter01] was again in use to cut a female part with ID femalePart[2293]. This operation took approximately 12.49 seconds, producing a formed part with ID formedPart[2293]. During this process, the machinery consumed 0.0190855 kWh of electricity from the grid, utilized 0.076 cubic meters of nitrogen gas, and emitted the same amount into the air, alongside 0.082 cubic meters of compressed air. The cutting process also generated 0.00254 kg of steel waste, with total carbon emissions of 0.0867 kg of CO2e recorded.

Finally, at 11:56:46 UTC, Machine with ID o_machine_cutter01 located at Workstation with ID o_workstation_2 operated to cut a male part identified as o_malepart_2407 from a formed part designated as o_formedpart_2407. This process, termed CuttMalePart, lasted approximately 9.94 seconds, with a CO2 equivalent emission of 0.073 kg. The operation consumed 0.0152 kWh of electrical energy, utilized 0.072 m³ of compressed air, and employed 0.061 m³ of nitrogen gas, which was also emitted in the same volume. The mass of the male part in this operation remains unspecified.

This summary captures all relevant events, emphasizing the activities and relationships between the various objects involved on April 4, 2023.
