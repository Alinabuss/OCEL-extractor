On April 5, 2023, the processing of the steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_4051 involved two significant operations. 

First, at 11:33:15 UTC, Machine[Splitter01] executed a splitting operation on a steel coil with ID SteelCoil[2] at Workstation[1]. This operation, which lasted approximately 14.973 seconds, resulted in the creation of the steel sheet o_steelsheet_4051, weighing 0.02115 kg. During this process, the operation generated 0.015656 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions and consumed around 0.0228759 kWh of electricity from the grid, along with producing a minimal steel waste of 0.00042 kg designated for recycling.

Shortly thereafter, at 11:34:13 UTC, a heating operation was performed on the same steel sheet o_steelsheet_4051 at Workstation[o_workstation_1] using Machine[o_machine_oven01]. This heating process lasted for 900 seconds and resulted in emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent. It utilized 0.02 kWh of electricity from the grid and produced additional gas emissions from burning 0.49392 Wh of gas, which corresponds to equivalent emissions.

In summary, both operations involved the same steel sheet, highlighting its processing journey from splitting to heating within a short time frame on April 5, 2023.
