**Heating Processes Report for Object o_machine_oven01**

On April 3, 2023, the machine identified as o_machine_oven01, located at workstation ID o_workstation_1, conducted a series of heating operations on multiple steel sheets. 

1. **Event 1:** At 08:43:28 UTC, a heating process was applied to a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_372, weighing 0.02118 kg. The operation lasted for 900 seconds, producing 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions. During this process, the machine consumed 0.02 kWh of electricity and utilized 0.49392 Wh of gas input.

2. **Event 2:** At 08:48:14 UTC, a second heating process involved a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_392, which has a mass of 0.02115 kg. This also lasted for 900 seconds and emitted 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent. Energy consumption from the grid was again 0.02 kWh, with a gas input of 0.49392 Wh.

3. **Event 3:** At 08:54:37 UTC, a heating operation was conducted on a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_419, weighing 0.02118 kg. The process duration was 900 seconds, emitting 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalents. It used 0.02 kWh of electricity and 0.49392 Wh of gas input.

4. **Event 4:** At 09:02:10 UTC, another heating process occurred on a steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[451], weighing 0.02113 kg. This operation also lasted 900 seconds, resulting in approximately 0.0138 kg of CO2 emissions. Energy consumption was recorded at 0.02 kWh, with a gas input of around 0.49392 Wh.

5. **Event 5:** Finally, at 09:21:11 UTC, the machine processed a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_531, which had a mass of 0.02102 kg. This heating operation lasted 900 seconds, again generating 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions. Energy drawn from the grid was 0.02 kWh, accompanied by a gas input of 0.49392 Wh.

Overall, each heating process consistently utilized o_machine_oven01 at the same workstation, demonstrating uniform energy consumption and emissions across the different steel sheets processed throughout the day.
