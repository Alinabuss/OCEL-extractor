**Report Summary for Object: o_steelcoil_3**

On April 4, 2023, at the workstation identified as "o_workstation_1," multiple splitting processes were conducted on the steel coil labeled "o_steelcoil_3," which has a mass of 31.91076 kg.

1. **Event at 07:44:00 UTC:**
   - The first splitting operation occurred using the machine "o_machine_splitter01," resulting in the creation of a steel sheet labeled "o_steelsheet_1529" weighing 0.02111 kg. The process lasted for 6.7639 seconds, emitting 0.0070772 kg of CO2 equivalent and consuming 0.0103337 kWh from the grid. A negligible amount of 0.00042 kg of steel waste was set for recycling.

2. **Event at 07:45:46 UTC:**
   - A subsequent operation utilized the same splitter machine on "o_steelcoil_3," producing a steel sheet identified as "o_steelsheet_1545," weighing 0.02123 kg. This operation took approximately 6.8375 seconds, generating 0.0071541 kg of CO2 emissions while also managing 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

3. **Event at 07:49:19 UTC:**
   - Another splitting process was performed by the machine labeled "Splitter01" on "o_steelcoil_3," resulting in a steel sheet weighing 0.02116 kg. The splitting lasted for 6.6393 seconds, with CO2 emissions recorded as 0.006947 kg and electricity consumption from the grid measured at 0.0101433 kWh, in addition to producing 0.00042 kg of steel waste.

4. **Event at 07:49:25 UTC:**
   - Shortly after, the machine "o_machine_splitter01" once again performed a splitting operation on "o_steelcoil_3," producing a steel sheet with the ID "o_steelsheet_1578" and weighing 0.02111 kg. This operation lasted approximately 6.76 seconds, with emissions of 0.0070783 kg of CO2 equivalent and energy usage from the grid recorded at 0.0103353 kWh, while also directing 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

5. **Event at 07:52:18 UTC:**
   - Finally, a splitting process was conducted on a steel sheet identified as "SteelSheet[1604]," which weighed 0.02117 kg. This operation took around 6.55 seconds, emitted 0.0068552 kg of CO2, and utilized "Machine[Splitter01]" at "Workstation[1]," consuming 0.0100092 kWh. The splitting was also related to the steel coil "o_steelcoil_3," maintaining its mass of 31.91076 kg and generating 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

This sequence of operations highlights the various splitting activities occurring on the same steel coil, "o_steelcoil_3," at distinct timestamps but primarily utilizing the same machinery at a single workstation.
