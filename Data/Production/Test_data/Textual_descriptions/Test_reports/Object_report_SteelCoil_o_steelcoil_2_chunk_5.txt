**Report on Object o_steelcoil_2**

On April 5, 2023, several operations involving steel coil ID o_steelcoil_2 were conducted at workstation o_workstation_1 using the machine identified as o_machine_splitter01.

1. The first activity occurred at **10:14:19 UTC**, where the machine split the steel coil, resulting in a steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[3774], weighing **0.02105 kg**. This operation lasted for approximately **14.19 seconds**, generating **0.00042 kg** of steel waste and emitting **0.01484 kg** of CO2 equivalent. The electricity consumed during this split was about **0.02168 kWh**, and the steel coil had a mass of **31.91076 kg**.

2. Shortly after, at **10:14:48 UTC**, another steel sheet was produced from the same steel coil. The machine again achieved the creation of a steel sheet weighing **0.0213 kg** after approximately **14.0569 seconds**. This process emitted **0.014698389 kg** of CO2, consumed **0.0214758 kWh** from the grid, and produced the same amount of steel waste, **0.00042 kg**, allocated for recycling.

3. The third operation, termed SplitSteelSheet, took place at **10:16:42 UTC**. A steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_3728, weighing **0.02094 kg**, was produced. The splitting lasted **14.379928507 seconds** and resulted in CO2 emissions of **0.015035943 kg**, with an electricity consumption of **0.0219693 kWh** while maintaining the steel waste generation at **0.00042 kg**.

4. The last two activities occurred later in the morning. At **10:27:35 UTC**, a steel sheet was again split at the same workstation, resulting in a new sheet weighing **0.02105 kg** with ID SteelSheet[3774]. This operation lasted **13.788 seconds**, and CO2 emissions measured **0.014417607 kg** accompanied by energy consumption of **0.0210653 kWh** and steel waste of **0.00042 kg**.

5. The final operation involving o_steelcoil_2 took place at **10:40:08 UTC**. This action generated steel sheet ID SteelSheet[3827] after a duration of **14.125 seconds**, with CO2 emissions recorded at **0.0147700722 kg** and electricity usage measured at **0.0215806 kWh**. As with all prior operations, **0.00042 kg** of steel waste was created for recycling.

Throughout these operations, o_steelcoil_2 played a crucial role, consistently demonstrating efficiency in producing steel sheets while managing environmental impacts and energy consumption effectively.
