On April 6, 2023, a series of significant operations took place involving various machines and parts at designated workstations. 

At 11:10:28 UTC, a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[5358], weighing 0.02105 kg, was processed using Machine[former02] located at Workstation[1]. This operation created a formed part with the ID FormedPart[5358] and required 0.0041667 kWh of electrical energy, lasting for 5 seconds. Additionally, the operation resulted in a CO2 emission of approximately 0.0028500228 kg.

Shortly after, at 11:19:38 UTC, Workstation[1] was again utilized to form a steel sheet using Machine[former02]. This process involved an input steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_5396, weighing 0.02124 kg, and resulted in the creation of a formed part identified as o_formedpart_5396. This operation also lasted for 5 seconds, consuming 0.0041667 kWh of electrical energy and generating the same CO2 emissions of 0.0028500228 kg.

Then, at 11:22:48 UTC, a machine known as o_machine_cutter01, located at Workstation[2], performed a cutting operation. It utilized a FormedPart with ID o_formedpart_5165, resulting in the production of a MalePart with ID o_malepart_5165. This cutting process lasted approximately 10.04 seconds and emitted 0.0679 kg of CO2e while consuming 0.0153 kWh of electricity, 0.063 m³ of compressed air, and 0.061 m³ of nitrogen gas.

Later, at 11:24:23 UTC, a part identified as FormedPart[5412] underwent a coating process at Workstation[1], utilizing Machine[coater03]. This operation lasted for 300 seconds, generating 0.1751156951 kg of CO2 emissions and consuming 0.25 kWh of electrical power. The process involved the use of 0.0004 kg of coating material and produced 0.0001 kg of coating material waste.

Finally, at 11:25:50 UTC, another part, identified as o_formedpart_5421, was also coated at Workstation[1], utilizing the same Machine[coater03]. This coating process corresponded to the previous one, lasting for 300 seconds and yielding similar CO2 emissions of 0.1751156951 kg, while consuming 0.25 kWh of electrical power and involving the same amounts of coating material and waste as earlier described.

All these operations on April 6, 2023, highlight a series of interconnected processes involving efficient machinery and material management.
