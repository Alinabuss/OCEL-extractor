**Report on Heating Processes Involving o_machine_oven01**

On April 4, 2023, the machine o_machine_oven01, located at workstation o_workstation_1, was utilized in a series of heating processes for various steel sheets, each lasting 900 seconds and resulting in consistent carbon emissions.

1. **1st Event**: At 10:39:21 UTC, the machine processed a SteelSheet with ID o_steelsheet_2342, weighing 0.0213 kg. This operation resulted in carbon dioxide emissions of approximately 0.0138019093344 kg. Energy consumption recorded was roughly 0.02 kWh, with gas input measured at 0.49392 Wh, yielding equivalent burn emissions.

2. **2nd Event**: Following this, at 10:41:47 UTC, a heating process was conducted on a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_2352, weighing 0.02129 kg. Similar to the first event, it emitted 0.0138019093344 kg of carbon dioxide, consumed 0.02 kWh of electricity, and utilized 0.49392 Wh of gas with matching emissions from the burn process.

3. **3rd Event**: At 10:50:30 UTC, o_machine_oven01 heated a steel sheet identified by ID o_steelsheet_2389, with a mass of 0.02109 kg. This process echoed previous results, with emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg CO2, 0.02 kWh of electric energy consumption, and a gas input of 0.49392 Wh correlated with equivalent burn emissions.

4. **4th Event**: The next process occurred at 10:58:36 UTC with the steel sheet ID o_steelsheet_2423. This event again resulted in carbon dioxide emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg, featuring the same energy consumption and gas input patterns of 0.02 kWh and 0.49392 Wh on burn emissions respectively.

5. **5th Event**: The final operation on this date happened at 11:06:51 UTC. The steel sheet, identified as o_steelsheet_2458, weighing 0.02109 kg, was similarly heated, leading to emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2. Energy consumption remained consistent at 0.02 kWh, with gas input again at 0.49392 Wh, matching previous emissions from burn.

Each heating process demonstrated the operational efficiency and environmental impact of o_machine_oven01 and the workstation o_workstation_1 throughout the specified time period.
