On April 6, 2023, several significant events took place involving various machines, workstations, and materials. 

At 08:51:17 UTC, the workstation with ID Workstation[1] was utilized to form a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[4770]. The operation, carried out by Machine[former02], lasted for 5.0 seconds and consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electricity from the grid, resulting in emissions of 0.0028500228 kg of CO2e. The process yielded a formed part with ID FormedPart[4770], which was created from the original steel sheet and had a mass of 0.02102 kg.

Following this, at 09:01:02 UTC, another machine, designated as Machine with ID "o_machine_former02," located at Workstation with ID "o_workstation_1," processed a different steel sheet, SteelSheet with ID "o_steelsheet_4814," weighing 0.02115 kg. This FormSteelSheet operation also lasted for 5 seconds, consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electricity, and emitted 0.0028500228 kg of CO2e. The outcome was a formed part with ID "o_formedpart_4814," illustrating the relationship between the steel sheet and the formed part produced.

At 09:02:10 UTC, Machine[form02] was engaged again at Workstation[1], this time transforming SteelSheet[4817] with a mass of 0.02116 kg. The transformation process drew 0.0041667 kWh of electricity and lasted for 5 seconds, generating emissions of 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 equivalent, although the mass of the resulting FormedPart[4817] was not specified.

Later in the day, at 09:10:07 UTC, a female part with ID FemalePart[4550] was utilized in a process that led to the creation of FormedPart[4550]. This operation, taking place at Workstation[2] with Machine ID Machine[cutter01], lasted for 12.5846422642 seconds. The process consumed 0.0192265 kWh of electricity and utilized significant amounts of resources, including 0.096 cubic meters of compressed air and 0.077 cubic meters of nitrogen gas, which were also emitted back into the atmosphere. Additionally, this operation generated 0.0945610237778 kg of CO2 emissions and 0.00255 kg of steel waste.

Finally, at 09:15:57 UTC, the machine with ID Machine[o_machine_cutter01], located at Workstation[o_workstation_2], conducted a cutting operation. This event involved producing a MalePart[o_malepart_4567] from the input FormedPart[o_formedpart_4567]. The cutting process lasted for 10.0128771559 seconds, generating 0.0629024588889 kg of CO2 emissions and consuming 0.0152975 kWh of electricity. The operation also required 0.053 m3 of compressed air and 0.061 m3 of nitrogen gas, contributing to additional emissions. While the cutting process produced amounts of steel waste, the exact quantity remains unspecified.

In summary, the operations on April 6, 2023, reflect a comprehensive process flow involving varied inputs and outputs across distinct workstations and machines, culminating in emissions and consumption of resources.
