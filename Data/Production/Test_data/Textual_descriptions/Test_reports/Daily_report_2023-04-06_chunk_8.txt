On April 6, 2023, a series of operations involving various machines and parts took place at different workstations.

At 10:44:36 UTC, a cutting operation was performed on a female part with ID o_femalepart_4998 at workstation ID o_workstation_2. This operation resulted in a formed part with the ID o_formedpart_4998, lasting approximately 12.607 seconds. The process emitted 0.08873 kg of CO2 equivalent, consuming 0.0192611 kWh of electricity from the grid, alongside 0.09 cubic meters of compressed air and 0.077 cubic meters of nitrogen gas, with 0.00252 kg of steel waste produced. The operation utilized the machine identified as o_machine_cutter01.

Following this, at 10:45:54 UTC, a formed part with ID o_formedpart_5255 underwent a coating process at workstation ID o_workstation_1. The coating process was carried out using machine ID o_machine_coater03, taking 300 seconds and generating 0.1751156951 kg of CO2 emissions. The operation consumed 0.25 kWh of electricity and involved 0.0004 kg of coating material, during which 0.0001 kg of coating material waste was produced.

Later, at 10:48:33 UTC, the machine identified as o_machine_cutter01 at workstation ID o_workstation_2 executed a cutting task on a male part, yielding a male part with ID o_malepart_5026. This operation lasted about 10.09 seconds, utilizing a formed part with ID FormedPart[o_formedpart_5026] as input. It led to emissions of 0.0728 kg of CO2 and included the consumption of 0.0154 kWh of electricity, with 0.07 cubic meters of compressed air and 0.062 cubic meters of nitrogen gas being used and emitted.

Shortly after, at 10:50:26 UTC, the same machine, Cutter01, was again used to cut a male part with ID MalePart[4976]. This operation, also conducted at workstation ID Workstation[2], lasted approximately 10.01 seconds and produced 0.076 kg of CO2 emissions. It consumed 0.015 kWh of electricity, utilized 0.08 m続 of compressed air, and 0.061 m続 of nitrogen gas, all of which were emitted into the air. The male part was produced from a formed part with the ID FormedPart[4976].

Finally, at 10:52:41 UTC, Cutter[01] operated at Workstation[2] to create a male part with ID MalePart[4953]. This process, which took about 10 seconds, generated 0.0649 kg of CO2 emissions while consuming 0.0153 kWh of electricity, 0.057 m続 of compressed air, and 0.061 m続 of nitrogen gas, with the same quantity emitted to the air. The male part produced, MalePart[4953], was formed from the original part ID FormedPart[4953].

Overall, the events of April 6, 2023, involved various machines, formed parts, and male parts, showcasing extensive manufacturing activity across multiple workstations and operations.
