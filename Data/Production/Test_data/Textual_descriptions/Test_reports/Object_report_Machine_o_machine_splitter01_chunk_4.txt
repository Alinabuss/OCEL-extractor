**Report for Object o_machine_splitter01**

On April 3, 2023, at Workstation[1], the machine identified as Machine[splitter01] was involved in multiple steel sheet splitting operations:

1. **First Event**: The initial splitting occurred at 09:58:25 UTC, lasting approximately 14.41 seconds. This operation created SteelSheet[692] from SteelCoil[4] (mass: 31.91076 kg), resulting in the emission of about 0.0151 kg of CO2. The process also generated 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling while drawing electric power from the grid.

2. **Second Event**: Shortly after, at 09:59:21 UTC, another split operation was performed. This event lasted around 14.2688 seconds and yielded SteelSheet[696] (mass: 0.02119 kg) from the same steel coil, SteelCoil[4]. Emissions were recorded at approximately 0.0149199 kg of CO2, and the machine consumed about 0.0217996 kWh of electricity. Additionally, it produced 0.00042 kg of steel waste intended for recycling.

3. **Third Event**: The machine continued to operate at 10:01:14 UTC for approximately 14.54 seconds, resulting in the creation of SteelSheet[o_steel_sheet_704] from SteelCoil[o_steelcoil_4] (mass: 31.91 kg). This operation emitted 0.0152 kg of CO2 and drew around 0.0222 kWh of electricity, while generating 0.00042 kg of steel waste.

4. **Fourth Event**: At 10:12:52 UTC, another splitting process lasted about 14.41 seconds, producing SteelSheet[753] (mass: 0.02121 kg) from SteelCoil[4]. This operation had emissions of 0.01507 kg of CO2, consumed approximately 0.02201 kWh from the grid, and generated 0.00042 kg of steel waste.

5. **Fifth Event**: The final operation documented occurred at 10:13:36 UTC, lasting around 13.91 seconds. It produced SteelSheet[756] (mass: approximately 0.021 kg) from SteelCoil[4]. This event resulted in approximately 0.0145 kg of CO2 emissions and consumed about 0.021 kWh of electricity, generating 0.00042 kg of steel waste.

Throughout these events, SteelCoil[4] served consistently as the input material for splitting, while Machine[splitter01] maintained its operation under Workstation[1].
