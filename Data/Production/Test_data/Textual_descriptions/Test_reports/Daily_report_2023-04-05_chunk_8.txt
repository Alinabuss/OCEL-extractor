On April 5, 2023, several significant events took place in the production process. At 11:16:23 UTC, a process was initiated to form a steel sheet using the machine identified as o_machine_former02 at workstation o_workstation_1. The input steel sheet, with ID o_steelsheet_3909, weighed 0.02105 kg. This formation lasted 5.0 seconds, resulting in the production of a formed part with ID o_formedpart_3909. The process emitted 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 equivalent and consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electrical energy from the grid.

Shortly after, at 11:18:55 UTC, the same machine (Machine[former02]) at Workstation[1] processed another steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[3919], weighing 0.02118 kg. This operation also took 5 seconds and created a formed part identified as FormedPart[3919]. Similar to the previous operation, it emitted 0.0028500228 kg of CO2e and used 0.0041667 kWh of electricity.

At 11:19:42 UTC, another operation was carried out by Machine[former02] at Workstation[1], this time forming a steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[3922], which weighed 0.02098 kg. This process lasted for 5 seconds and resulted in a formed part with ID FormedPart[3922]. The energy consumption and emissions mirrored those of the previous processes, with 0.0041667 kWh of electricity used and 0.0028500228 kg of CO2e emitted.

Later in the day, at 11:31:14 UTC, a forming process took place using a steel sheet that weighed 0.02125 kg. The operation occurred at a workstation with machine "machine former02". This process took 5.0 seconds, producing a formed part identified as "formedpart_3973" and resulting in the same emissions and electricity consumption as previously recorded: 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 equivalent and 0.0041667 kWh of electricity.

Finally, at 11:36:50 UTC, a cutting operation was performed using machine cutter01 at workstation 2, where it processed a female part with ID FemalePart[3777]. This operation lasted approximately 12.40 seconds and resulted in the generation of formed part ID FormedPart[3777]. During this task, the machine emitted 0.08785 kg of CO2e, consumed 0.01895 kWh of electricity, utilized 0.087 m³ of compressed air, and emitted 0.076 m³ of nitrogen gas, as well as generating 0.00256 kg of steel waste.
