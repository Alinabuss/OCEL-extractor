**Report for Object: o_machine_splitter01**

On April 6, 2023, the machine identified as o_machine_splitter01, located at Workstation 1, conducted a series of operations involving steel coils and steel sheets.

1. **Event 1**: At 09:33:59 UTC, o_machine_splitter01 processed a steel coil with ID 1 (mass: 31.91076 kg) to create a steel sheet with ID 5024 (mass: 0.02123 kg). This splitting process, lasting 14.4084851982 seconds, produced approximately 0.0150658338 kg of CO2 emissions and generated 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling. The operation consumed 0.022013 kWh of electrical energy.

2. **Event 2**: At 09:35:39 UTC, the machine performed another splitting operation utilizing the same steel coil (ID: steelcoil_1) to create a new steel sheet with ID steelsheet_5031 (mass: 0.02096 kg). This operation lasted approximately 13.90 seconds, produced around 0.01454 kg of CO2 emissions, and generated 0.00042 kg of steel waste. The machine consumed about 0.02124 kWh of electricity.

3. **Event 3**: At 09:42:45 UTC, o_machine_splitter01 split a steel sheet, using the steel coil (ID: o_steelcoil_1, mass: 31.91076 kg) as input, resulting in a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_5061 (mass: 0.02113 kg). This process took approximately 14.10 seconds, generating 0.01475 kg of CO2 emissions and resulting in 0.00042 kg of steel waste. 

4. **Event 4**: At 09:50:06 UTC, o_machine_splitter01 carried out a SplitSteelSheet operation. The input was a steel coil (ID: SteelCoil[1], mass: 31.91076 kg), leading to the creation of a steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[5092] (mass: 0.02108 kg). This operation lasted about 14.413 seconds and generated approximately 0.015 kg of CO2 emissions, while consuming around 0.022 kWh of electricity, along with producing 0.00042 kg of steel waste.

5. **Event 5**: Finally, at 09:59:48 UTC, the machine executed another splitting operation that lasted 14.0938456201 seconds, using SteelCoil[1] (mass: 31.91076 kg) as the input, producing a steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[5133] (mass: 0.02154 kg). This event generated approximately 0.014737035 kg of CO2 emissions and consumed 0.0215323 kWh of electrical energy, alongside producing 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

Throughout these operations, o_machine_splitter01 efficiently managed energy consumption and waste generation, demonstrating its role in transforming raw steel materials into refined products while maintaining sustainability.
