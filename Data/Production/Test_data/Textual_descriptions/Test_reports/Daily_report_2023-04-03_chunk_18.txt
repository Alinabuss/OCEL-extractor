On April 3, 2023, several significant processes occurred involving various machines and parts. 

At 13:04:00 UTC, Machine[form_02] was utilized at Workstation[1] to form a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[1401], which had a mass of 0.02119 kg. This operation lasted for 5 seconds and resulted in the creation of a formed part, FormedPart[1401]. The process generated 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 emissions and consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electric power from the grid. The formed part was the output of this activity, with the original steel sheet serving as the input.

Shortly after, at 13:11:09 UTC, another steel sheet, SteelSheet[1432] with a mass of 0.02105 kg, was processed at Workstation[1] using Machine[former02]. Like the previous operation, this action lasted for 5 seconds, resulting in the creation of FormedPart[1432], along with 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 emissions and a consumption of 0.0041667 kWh of electricity from the grid.

At 13:18:58 UTC, another process occurred at Workstation[o_workstation_1] where the machine identified as "o_machine_former02" formed a steel sheet (ID: o_steelsheet_1460) weighing 0.02137 kg. The formation process lasted for 5 seconds, producing 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 emissions and consuming 0.0041667 kWh of electric power. The formed output from this operation was recorded as o_formedpart_1460.

Later in the day, at 13:25:56 UTC, a female part was cut using Machine Cutter 01 at Workstation 2. This operation lasted approximately 12.58 seconds, generating 0.089 kg
