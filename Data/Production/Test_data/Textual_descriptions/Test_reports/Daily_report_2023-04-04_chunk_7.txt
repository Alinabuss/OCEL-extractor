On April 4, 2023, several significant operations took place involving various machines and parts throughout the day. 

At 11:12:19 UTC, a steel sheet weighing 0.021 kg was processed at Workstation 1 using Machine with ID "o_machine_former02". This forming operation lasted 5.0 seconds, transforming the steel sheet into an unspecified formed part. The process required approximately 0.0041667 kWh of electric energy from the grid, and resulted in the emission of 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 equivalent.

Later, at 11:22:10 UTC, another operation was conducted at Workstation 2, where a male part identified as MalePart[2176] underwent cutting with Machine[cutter01]. This process took around 10.04 seconds and produced the same male part as output, utilizing approximately 0.0153 kWh of electricity, 0.073 cubic meters of compressed air, and 0.061 cubic meters of nitrogen gas, which was also emitted in a similar volume. Some steel waste was generated during this process, though its quantity was not specified. The male part was derived from a formed part labeled FormedPart[2176].

At 11:27:13 UTC, Machine[cutter01] was again employed at Workstation 2 to cut a female part with ID FemalePart[2085]. This cutting operation lasted approximately 12.42 seconds, resulting in the creation of a FormedPart identified as FormedPart[2085]. The operation consumed 0.01898 kWh of electric energy, 0.068 cubic meters of compressed air, and 0.076 cubic meters of nitrogen gas, with emissions matching the nitrogen gas usage. Additionally, the process generated 0.00255 kg of steel waste and emitted 0.08289 kg of CO2 equivalent. 

Shortly thereafter, at 11:28:33 UTC, Machine[o_machine_cutter01] executed a cutting process at Workstation[o_workstation_2] involving the formed part with ID FormedPart[o_formedpart_2020]. This lasted approximately 9.89 seconds and produced a male part with ID MalePart[o_malepart_2020]. The operation recorded an electricity consumption of 0.0151125 kWh and used 0.066 m³ of compressed air as well as 0.06 m³ of nitrogen gas, with the same amount emitted into the atmosphere. Unfortunately, the mass of the resulting male part and the quantity of steel waste produced were not specified. 

This summary encapsulates all essential details for the events occurring on April 4, 2023, highlighting the interactions and outputs of specific machines and parts involved in the processes.
