On April 6, 2023, multiple events took place, beginning at 12:45:09 UTC, when a machine identified as Machine[former02] utilized approximately 0.0041667 kWh of electric energy to form a steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[5758] and an initial mass of 0.02129 kg into a finished product referred to as a formed part. This operation, which occurred at Workstation[1], lasted for 5 seconds and emitted 0.0028500228 kg of CO2e. The formed part produced from this process was designated as a formed part without a specific mass value.

Shortly after, at 12:51:47 UTC, a coating process commenced at Workstation[1], where the formed part with ID o_formedpart_5784 was coated using Machine[coater03]. This operation lasted 300 seconds and consumed 0.25 kWh of electricity from the grid while utilizing 0.0004 kg of coating material. The process emitted approximately 0.175 kg of CO2 equivalent and resulted in 0.0001 kg of coating material waste.

At 12:54:16 UTC, another coating occurred at Workstation[1] involving the part identified as FormedPart[5794]. Conducted again with Machine[coater03], this coating process also took 300 seconds, consuming 0.25 kWh of electric energy and using the same amount of coating material, producing 0.0001 kg of coating material waste and emitting around 0.1751 kg of CO2 equivalent.

The operations continued with an additional coating at 12:57:30 UTC where the part labeled as FormedPart[5805] underwent the same coating process at Workstation[1] with Machine[coater03]. This event lasted for 300 seconds and produced emissions of 0.1751156951 kg CO2e, alongside utilizing the same specifications as previous coating operations, including the consumption of 0.25 kWh of electricity and generating 0.0001 kg of coating material waste.

Finally, at 13:02:12 UTC, another forming operation took place using Machine[former02] at Workstation[1]. This time, a steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[5827] and mass of 0.02114 kg was processed over a period of 5 seconds. The operation resulted in the creation of a formed part identified as FormedPart[5827], producing emissions of 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 equivalent while consuming 0.0041667 kWh of electricity from the grid. 

Overall, this day marked significant transformations within the manufacturing process, from steel sheet formation to multiple coating applications, each contributing to emissions and waste outputs along the production line.
