**Combined Report for Object o_steelcoil_2**

On April 5, 2023, multiple operations involving the object o_steelcoil_2 were executed at Workstation[1] utilizing the machine known as Splitter01.

1. The first operation occurred at 08:47:47 UTC, where Splitter01 processed a steel coil, resulting in the creation of a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[3354]. This operation lasted approximately 13.87 seconds, emitted 0.0145 kg of CO2 equivalent, consumed 0.0212 kWh of electricity, and generated 0.00042 kg of recyclable steel waste. The initial steel coil weighed 31.91076 kg.

2. Subsequently, at 09:00:21 UTC, another splitting operation was conducted on a steel coil (SteelCoil[2]), which created a new steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[3407]. This process lasted around 14.16 seconds, produced 0.0148 kg of CO2 equivalent, consumed 0.0216 kWh of electricity, and also resulted in 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

3. At 09:14:36 UTC, yet another split operation was executed on a steel sheet (SteelSheet[3467]), derived from SteelCoil[2]. This operation took 14.266 seconds, emitted approximately 0.014917 kg of CO2, and consumed 0.0217954 kWh of electricity. The amount of steel waste generated was again 0.00042 kg, designated for recycling.

4. The next operation occurred at 09:17:26 UTC, where Machine[splitter01] again split SteelCoil[2], resulting in a steel sheet labeled SteelSheet[3479]. This process lasted about 14.2767 seconds and produced 0.014928 kg of CO2 emissions, consuming 0.0218117 kWh of electricity and yielding 0.00042 kg of steel waste as well.

5. Finally, at 09:19:06 UTC, a steel sheet labeled o_steelsheet_3486 was created using o_steelcoil_2 in a splitting operation that took approximately 14.94 seconds. This process generated 0.0156204 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions and produced 0.00042 kg of steel waste intended for recycling, while consuming 0.0228237 kWh of electricity at Workstation[1].

These operations demonstrate the continuous processing of steel coil o_steelcoil_2, resulting in various steel sheets throughout the day, all undertaken at the designated workstation with associated emissions and waste management.
