**Report on Heating Processes Involving o_machine_oven01**

During the period from April 5 to April 6, 2023, the machine identified as o_machine_oven01, located at workstation o_workstation_1, carried out several heating processes on various steel sheets.

1. **April 5, 2023, 13:04:26 UTC**: The machine processed a steel sheet (SteelSheet[o_steelsheet_4431]) with a mass of 0.02133 kg. The heating lasted for 900 seconds and resulted in CO2 equivalent emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg. For this operation, the machine consumed 0.02 kWh of electricity from the grid and utilized 0.49392 Wh of gas, correlating with the emissions produced.

2. **April 6, 2023, 07:41:23 UTC**: A heating process was conducted on a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[o_steelsheet_4451]. The operation lasted for 900 seconds, producing emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent, along with electricity consumption of 0.02 kWh and gas input of 0.49392 Wh. This process also recorded a burn emission of 0.49392 Wh.

3. **April 6, 2023, 07:43:57 UTC**: Another heating event occurred on steel sheet o_steelsheet_4474, lasting 900 seconds and generating emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2. The operation used the same energy requirementsâ€”0.02 kWh from the grid and 0.49392 Wh of gas, with a corresponding burn emission of 0.49392 Wh. The mass of this particular steel sheet was 0.02118 kg.

4. **April 6, 2023, 07:47:43 UTC**: The same machine processed steel sheet o_steelsheet_4508 for 900 seconds at workstation o_workstation_1. The process again resulted in CO2 emissions of approximately 0.0138019093344 kg, consuming 0.02 kWh of electricity from the grid and 0.49392 Wh of gas, leading to a burn emission also recorded at 0.49392 Wh. The mass for this sheet was noted as 0.02113 kg.

5. **April 6, 2023, 07:48:54 UTC**: Finally, the machine treated steel sheet o_steelsheet_4519, which had a mass of 0.02106 kg. This heating process lasted 900 seconds, yielding CO2 emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg. The energy inputs mirrored previous operations with 0.02 kWh from the grid and 0.49392 Wh of gas, with a corresponding burn emission of 0.49392 Wh.

In summary, all heating processes utilized similar parameters in terms of duration, emissions, and energy consumption across the various steel sheets processed by o_machine_oven01 at workstation o_workstation_1.
