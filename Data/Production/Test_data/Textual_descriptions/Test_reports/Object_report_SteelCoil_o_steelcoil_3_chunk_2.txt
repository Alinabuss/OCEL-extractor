**Summary Report for Object o_steelcoil_3**

On April 4, 2023, the steel coil identified as o_steelcoil_3, with a mass of 31.91076 kg, was utilized in a series of operations at the workstation o_workstation_1 involving the machine o_machine_splitter01.

1. **Event 1**: At **08:03:53 UTC**, o_machine_splitter01 performed a steel sheet splitting process using o_steelcoil_3, resulting in the creation of a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_1690, which weighed 0.02113 kg. This process lasted approximately **14.0037 seconds**, emitted **0.0146 kg** of CO2, consumed **0.0214 kWh** of electricity, and produced **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling.

2. **Event 2**: Shortly after, at **08:06:30 UTC**, the same machine processed the steel coil o_steelcoil_3, yielding a new steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[1701]. This operation took around **14.4984 seconds**, producing **0.0152 kg** of CO2 emissions and using **0.0222 kWh** of electricity. The operation again resulted in **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling.

3. **Event 3**: At **08:16:01 UTC**, o_machine_splitter01 was again utilized to split a steel sheet derived from o_steelcoil_3. This operation required **13.9999 seconds**, generated **0.0146 kg** of CO2, consumed **0.0213888 kWh** of electricity, and produced **0.00042 kg** of steel waste, with the resulting steel sheet weighing 0.02128 kg.

4. **Event 4**: At **08:18:25 UTC**, a further splitting process occurred, yielding SteelSheet[1751] with a mass of **0.02134 kg**. This task lasted **approximately 13.93 seconds**, caused **0.01456 kg** of CO2 emissions, utilized **0.0212765 kWh** of electricity, and produced **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling.

5. **Event 5**: Finally, at **08:23:53 UTC**, o_machine_splitter01 executed another splitting task using o_steelcoil_3, resulting in the steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[1774], weighing **0.02126 kg**. This operation took **15.15 seconds**, emitted **0.01584 kg** of CO2, and consumed **0.0231412 kWh** of electricity, while again producing **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling.

Throughout these events, the steel coil o_steelcoil_3 was consistently transformed into various steel sheets, demonstrating its integral role in the splitting processes carried out at o_workstation_1.
