**Report on Heating Events for Object Machine[oven01]**

On April 4, 2023, multiple heating processes were conducted at Workstation[1] using Machine[oven01] to heat various steel sheets.

1. The first event took place at **11:35:58 UTC** involving a steel sheet identified as **SteelSheet[2580]** weighing **0.02135 kg**. The heating lasted for **900 seconds**, generating **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2 equivalent emissions. The energy consumption for this process was **0.02 kWh**, with a gas input of **0.49392 Wh** and equivalent emissions from burning also recorded at **0.49392 Wh**.

2. Shortly after, at **11:36:58 UTC**, another heating process began using Machine[oven01] to heat a steel sheet identified as **SteelSheet[2584]**, weighing **0.02123 kg**. This process had the same duration of **900 seconds**, with emissions recorded at **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2. It also consumed **0.02 kWh** of electricity from the grid and utilized a gas input of **0.49392 Wh**, matching the emissions from burning.

3. The third heating event occurred at **11:43:23 UTC** for a steel sheet identified as **SteelSheet[2611]**. This process, like the others, lasted for **900 seconds**, producing approximately **0.0138 kg** of CO2 emissions. It consumed **0.02 kWh** of electrical energy, with a gas input and emissions from burning both at **0.49392 Wh**.

4. At **11:49:48 UTC**, a further heating operation was carried out for steel sheet **SteelSheet[2638]**, weighing **0.02129 kg**. This heating, referred to as **HeatSteelSheet**, lasted **900 seconds** with energy consumption at **0.02 kWh**. The gas input was recorded at **0.49392 Wh**, resulting in emissions from burning at the same value of **0.49392 Wh**, along with carbon dioxide equivalent emissions of **0.0138019093344 kg**.

5. The last documented heating process on the same day occurred at **12:05:05 UTC** for the steel sheet identified as **SteelSheet[2702]**, which weighed **0.02127 kg**. This operation also had a duration of **900 seconds** and produced emissions of **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2. Energy consumption was registered at **0.02 kWh**, with a gas input and emissions from burning similarly noted at **0.49392 Wh**.

All heating processes occurred at Workstation[1] utilizing Machine[oven01], consistently yielding emissions and energy consumption figures across different steel sheets.
