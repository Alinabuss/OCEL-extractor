On April 5, 2023, the heating operations involving the machine o_machine_oven01 at workstation o_workstation_1 generated multiple events related to various steel sheets.

1. The first event occurred at 08:19:58 UTC, where a steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[3233] weighing 0.02136 kg was heated for 900 seconds. This operation emitted approximately 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent, consumed 0.02 kWh of electricity, and utilized 0.49392 Wh of gas, which also accounted for the burn emissions.

2. Shortly after, at 08:46:47 UTC, a second heating process involved a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_3346 (mass: 0.02135 kg), also for 900 seconds. The emissions were consistent, at 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2e, with the same energy consumption as the previous event: 0.02 kWh of electricity and a gas input of 0.49392 Wh, along with burn emissions matching that value.

3. At 08:53:28 UTC, another steel sheet (ID o_steelsheet_3374; mass: 0.02125 kg) underwent heating for 900 seconds. The results were similar, with emissions again at 0.0138019093344 kg CO2e, and energy utilization recorded at 0.02 kWh and 0.49392 Wh for both gas input and burn emissions.

4. The fourth event took place at 09:09:22 UTC, involving the heating of a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_3441, which weighed 0.0212 kg. This process, categorized as HeatSteelSheet, also lasted 900 seconds and emitted 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent, consuming 0.02 kWh from the grid, alongside a gas input of 0.49392 Wh and equivalent emissions from the burn.

5. Lastly, at 09:11:15 UTC, the heating of another steel sheet, SteelSheet[3449] (mass: 0.02118 kg), occurred. Similar to previous operations, this heating process took 900 seconds, resulting in emissions of approximately 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2e, with energy utilized recorded at 0.02 kWh, and gas input and burn emissions both at 0.49392 Wh.

Overall, all heating processes involving o_machine_oven01 on April 5, 2023, for various steel sheets reflected consistent energy consumption and emissions metrics, highlighting the stability of the operations conducted within this timeframe.
