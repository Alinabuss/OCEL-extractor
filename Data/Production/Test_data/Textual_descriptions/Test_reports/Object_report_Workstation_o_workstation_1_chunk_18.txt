**Event Summary for Object o_workstation_1**

On April 4, 2023, multiple events occurred at Workstation[1] involving various processes related to steel sheets derived from SteelCoil[3].

1. At **08:06:30 UTC**, a machine identified as **Machine[Splitter01]** processed **SteelCoil[3]**, leading to the creation of **SteelSheet[1701]**. This operation lasted approximately **14.4984 seconds**, resulting in **0.0152 kg** of CO2 emissions and consuming **0.0222 kWh** of electricity. The operation also produced **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling.

2. Shortly after, at **08:08:13 UTC**, the steel sheet **SteelSheet[1704]** (mass **0.02131 kg**) underwent a heating process named **HeatSteelSheet**, which lasted for **900 seconds** and emitted **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2. This process utilized **0.02 kWh** of electricity, with additional inputs of **0.49392 Wh** of gas and an equal amount emitted from the burning process. The machine used during this operation was **Machine[oven01]**.

3. Following the heating, at **08:16:01 UTC**, another steel sheet was split using **Machine[Splitter01]**. This operation lasted approximately **13.9999 seconds**, generating **0.0146 kg** of CO2 emissions, consuming **0.0213888 kWh** of electricity, and producing an additional **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling. The steel sheet used in this process had a mass of **0.02128 kg** and originated from **SteelCoil[3]**, which initially had a mass of **31.91076 kg**.

4. At **08:17:12 UTC**, another heating process was conducted for a steel sheet identified as **o_steelsheet_1742**, with a mass of **0.02135 kg**. This heating operation lasted **900 seconds**, generated **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2, and utilized **0.02 kWh** of electricity, along with **0.49392 Wh** of gas and equivalent emissions from burning.

5. Finally, at **08:18:25 UTC**, another splitting event occurred at Workstation[1] involving **Machine[Splitter01]**. This process lasted approximately **13.93 seconds** and resulted in the production of **SteelSheet[1751]** with a mass of **0.02134 kg**, also derived from **SteelCoil[3]**. The operation emitted **0.01456 kg** of CO2 and consumed **0.0212765 kWh** of electricity, alongside the generation of **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling.

These events collectively highlight the various processes occurring at Workstation[1] involving the utilization of SteelCoil[3] and the efficient production of steel sheets through splitting and heating operations.
