**Report on Object: o_machine_splitter01**

On April 6, 2023, the machine identified as Splitter01, located at Workstation[1], was involved in multiple operations concerning the steel coil SteelCoil[1].

1. The first operation occurred at **12:19:29 UTC**, where Splitter01 carried out a splitting process on SteelCoil[1]. This resulted in the creation of SteelSheet[5722], which had a mass of **0.02114 kg**. The operation lasted approximately **14.97 seconds**, emitting **0.01565 kg** of CO2 and producing **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling. The energy consumption during this operation was **0.02287 kWh**.

2. A subsequent splitting operation took place at **12:44:11 UTC**, resulting in the creation of SteelSheet[5826] from the same steel coil, SteelCoil[1]. This process lasted about **14.37 seconds**, with CO2 emissions of **0.015 kg** and generated **0.00042 kg** of steel waste intended for recycling. Energy consumption was recorded at **0.02195 kWh**.

3. At **12:46:04 UTC**, Splitter01 conducted another operation, resulting in SteelSheet[5834], also produced from SteelCoil[1]. The operation took roughly **14.41 seconds**, with emissions of **0.01506 kg** of CO2, yielding **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling, and consuming **0.02201 kWh** of electricity.

4. The final operation on April 6, 2023, occurred at **12:51:35 UTC**, where the machine split another sheet resulting in SteelSheet[5857], derived from SteelCoil[1]. This operation lasted approximately **13.63 seconds**, generating **0.0143 kg** of CO2 emissions and producing **0.00042 kg** of steel waste directed for recycling, with an energy use of **0.02083 kWh**.

Throughout all operations, SteelCoil[1] maintained a weight of **31.91076 kg**, while the newly created sheets had varying weights: **0.02114 kg** (SteelSheet[5722]), **0.02119 kg** (SteelSheet[5857]), and respective mass values for SteelSheet[5826] and SteelSheet[5834] were not specified. Each operation reflects the efficient processing of materials at Workstation[1].
