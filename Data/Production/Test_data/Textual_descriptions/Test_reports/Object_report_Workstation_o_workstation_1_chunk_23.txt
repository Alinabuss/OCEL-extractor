**Report for Workstation o_workstation_1**

On April 4, 2023, several heating processes were conducted at workstation o_workstation_1 using the machine identified as o_machine_oven01.

1. The first process began at 09:30:13 UTC, involving a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_2050, which weighed 0.02117 kg. This heating lasted for 900 seconds, leading to a CO2 emission of 0.0138019093344 kg, with an electricity consumption of 0.02 kWh and a gas input of 0.49392 Wh, which resulted in equivalent emissions from burning.

2. Shortly after, at 09:32:51 UTC, another heating process was performed on a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_2061, having a mass of 0.02116 kg. This operation also lasted for 900 seconds and generated 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 emissions. The electricity used was 0.02 kWh, and the gas input recorded was 0.49392 Wh, producing corresponding emissions.

3. The third heating process took place at 09:37:50 UTC for a steel sheet identified as o_steelsheet_2082, which weighed 0.0214 kg. This event also lasted 900 seconds, resulting in emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg CO2. The electricity consumed was again 0.02 kWh, accompanied by a gas input of 0.49392 Wh, leading to equivalent emissions from burning.

4. An additional operation occurred at 09:46:11 UTC, where a machine, splitter01, located at workstation 1, split a steel sheet with ID 2121. This process lasted approximately 15.1 seconds and produced 0.01579 kg of CO2 emissions while consuming 0.02307 kWh of electricity. The operation created a new steel sheet with ID 2121, weighing 0.02097 kg, derived from a steel coil identified as coil 3, with a mass of 31.91076 kg. Moreover, this process generated 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

5. Finally, at 09:49:44 UTC, a heating process was executed for the steel sheet labeled SteelSheet[2132], which weighed 0.02125 kg. This heating operation also lasted for 900 seconds and emitted 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent. The process consumed 0.02 kWh of electricity and recorded a gas input of 0.49392 Wh, resulting in similar emissions as observed in previous heating events.

All events highlight the operations at workstation o_workstation_1, showcasing extensive use of the heating machine and subsequent processes for steel sheets.
