On April 4, 2023, a series of operations involving the machine identified as Machine[former02] took place at Workstation[1], focusing on the processing of steel sheets and the creation of formed parts. 

The first event occurred at 08:06:02 UTC, where Machine[former02] was utilized to form a SteelSheet[1572] with a mass of 0.0211 kg. This operation lasted 5 seconds, resulting in the creation of a formed part (mass unspecified), emitting approximately 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 and consuming about 0.0041667 kWh of electricity from the grid.

Shortly after, at 08:14:16 UTC, the same machine operated to form a SteelSheet[1653] weighing 0.02109 kg. This process also lasted for 5 seconds, creating the formed part identified as FormedPart[1653]. The operation consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electricity and emitted 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 equivalent, clearly indicating the machine's ongoing engagement in similar tasks.

At 08:14:34 UTC, yet another steel sheet weighing 0.02109 kg was processed at Workstation[1] using Machine[former02]. This operation, which also took 5 seconds, resulted in a formed part and emitted 0.0028500228 kg of CO2e, with the machine consuming the same amount of electricity from the grid during this task.

Later, at 08:17:29 UTC, a formed part was created from a steel sheet with a mass of 0.0211 kg in the same workstation. This process again lasted 5.0 seconds, leading to an output formed part, while emitting 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 and consuming 0.0041667 kWh of electricity.

Finally, at 08:19:25 UTC, a new steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[1685] and a mass of 0.02114 kg was processed. Machine[former02] was again utilized for a 5.0-second operation, leading to the creation of a formed part with ID FormedPart[1685]. The operation continued to display consistent energy and emission profiles, consuming 0.0041667 kWh of electric power and emitting 0.0028500228 kg of CO2.

Overall, throughout April 4, 2023, the utilization of Machine[former02] at Workstation[1] facilitated the processing of multiple steel sheets and successfully resulted in the creation of formed parts while maintaining consistent operational metrics.
