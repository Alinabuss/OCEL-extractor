On April 3, 2023, several significant manufacturing operations took place at Workstation[2] involving various parts and machines. 

At 13:52:24 UTC, Machine[cutter01] was employed to cut a male part with ID MalePart[1075]. The cutting process lasted approximately 10.11 seconds, resulting in the production of a formed part identified as FormedPart[1075]. During this operation, the machine consumed 0.0154487 kWh of electricity, 0.037 cubic meters of compressed air, and utilized 0.062 cubic meters of nitrogen gas (N2). The process also generated emissions of 0.062 cubic meters of N2 and approximately 0.0579 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions.

Shortly after, at 13:53:42 UTC, another cutting operation was performed on a formed part with ID FormedPart[1247], again using Machine[cutter01]. This operation produced a female part with ID FemalePart[1247] and lasted around 12.42 seconds. The energy consumption for this process was 0.01898 kWh, along with 0.075 m³ of compressed air and 0.076 m³ of nitrogen gas. The operation also emitted 0.076 m³ of nitrogen gas and generated 0.00254 kg of steel waste.

Later, at 14:23:34 UTC, a male part was produced from an unspecified formed part using the same machine at Workstation[2]. This cutting operation took about 9.92 seconds and resulted in CO2 emissions of approximately 0.0666 kg. The machine consumed 0.0152 kWh of electricity, utilized 0.059 m³ of compressed air, and 0.061 m³ of nitrogen gas. The process also emitted 0.061 m³ of nitrogen gas, while the mass of the produced male part and any steel waste remained unspecified.

At 14:34:03 UTC, a cutting operation was conducted on a formed part with ID FormedPart[1218] at Workstation[2] using a machine named Machine[cutting_machine_01]. The operation lasted approximately 9.95 seconds and produced a male part, identified as MalePart[1218]. Energy consumption for this process was 0.0152 kWh, with additional use of 0.068 m³ of compressed air and 0.061 m³ of nitrogen gas. Emissions totaled around 0.073 kg of CO2 equivalent, and 0.061 m³ of nitrogen gas was released into the air. Details regarding the mass of the produced male part and steel waste were not provided.

Finally, at 14:35:20 UTC, another cutting operation took place using a machine identified as "Machine" with ID "o_machine_cutter01," situated at Workstation[o_workstation_2]. This process involved the female part with ID "o_femalepart_1274," leading to the creation of a formed part specified as "o_formedpart_1274." The cutting lasted for approximately 12.42 seconds and resulted in CO2 emissions of about 0.0823 kg. Energy consumption was recorded at 0.0189784 kWh, using 0.065 m³ of compressed air alongside 0.076 m³ of nitrogen gas. Steel waste generated during this operation amounted to 0.00253 kg. In this event, the formed part served as the input, while the female part was the output. 

Overall, April 3, 2023, was a busy day marked by multiple cutting operations at Workstation[2], leading to the production of various formed parts and their respective emissions and resource consumption.
