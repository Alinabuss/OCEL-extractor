On April 4, 2023, several significant manufacturing events occurred, each involving various components and processes. 

At 09:45:39 UTC, a formed part with ID o_formedpart_2045 was created as output from a steel sheet identified by ID o_steelsheet_2045, which had a mass of 0.02131 kg. This operation took place at workstation ID o_workstation_1, utilizing machine ID o_machine_former02. The process lasted for 5.0 seconds, resulting in CO2 emissions of 0.0028500228 kg and consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electricity.

Shortly after, at 10:00:32 UTC, machine Cutter01 at Workstation 2 processed a MalePart with ID o_malepart_1667. This operation, which lasted approximately 9.94 seconds, generated CO2 emissions of 0.0644 kg. The machine consumed 0.0152 kWh of electric energy, along with 0.052 m³ of compressed air and 0.061 m³ of nitrogen gas, which was also emitted in the same amount. The MalePart derived from a formed part with ID o_formedpart_1667. During this operation, there was a note regarding steel waste, although specific quantities were not provided.

At 10:14:19 UTC, the same machine, identified by ID "o_machine_cutter01," was utilized to cut a Female Part with ID "o_femalepart_1920" into a Formed Part with ID "o_formedpart_1920" at Workstation ID "o_workstation_2." The cutting process took 12.589 seconds and resulted in a carbon dioxide equivalent emission of 0.0799488685778 kg. Energy consumption for this process was 0.0192337 kWh, and inputs included 0.061 m³ of compressed air and 0.077 m³ of nitrogen gas, which was likewise released into the air. Additionally, a steel waste of 0.00255 kg was created.

At 10:18:26 UTC, another operation involving a female part with ID FemalePart[1818] was completed by the same cutting machine at the same workstation. This operation, known as CuttFemalePart, had a duration of approximately 12.6 seconds and resulted in emissions of 0.0806 kg of CO2 equivalent. During this time, the machine consumed around 0.0193 kWh of electricity and utilized 0.069 m³ of compressed air and 0.077 m³ of nitrogen gas. The operation also produced approximately 0.00254 kg of steel waste, culminating in a new female part identified as FemalePart[1818] created from a formed part with ID FormedPart[1818].

Finally, at 10:26:31 UTC, a steel sheet with a mass of 0.02126 kg was processed at workstation ID Workstation[1]. This operation lasted for 5 seconds and utilized machine ID Machine[former02]. It consumed 0.0041667 kWh from the grid, resulting in total CO2 emissions of 0.0028500228 kg and creating a formed part labeled FormedPart[2221], which was derived from the steel sheet. 

Overall, April 4, 2023, was marked by progressive manufacturing activities involving various parts and processes, with significant energy consumption and emissions noted throughout the events.
