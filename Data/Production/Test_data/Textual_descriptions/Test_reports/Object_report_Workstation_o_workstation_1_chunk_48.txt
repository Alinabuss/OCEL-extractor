### Report for Object o_workstation_1

This report consolidates the events related to object o_workstation_1.

1. On April 5, 2023, at 13:04:26 UTC, a machine with ID Machine[o_machine_oven01] located at Workstation[o_workstation_1] processed a steel sheet (ID: SteelSheet[o_steelsheet_4431]) by applying heat. The process lasted 900 seconds, resulting in a CO2 equivalent emission of 0.0138019093344 kg. The machine consumed 0.02 kWh of electricity from the grid and utilized 0.49392 Wh of gas. The steel sheet had a mass of 0.02133 kg.

2. On April 6, 2023, at 07:41:23 UTC, another heating process took place on Workstation[o_workstation_1] using Machine[o_machine_oven01]. This involved a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[4451], which lasted 900 seconds, emitting 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent. The energy usage was 0.02 kWh from the grid and 0.49392 Wh of gas, leading to a burn emission of 0.49392 Wh.

3. On the same day, shortly after, at 07:43:35 UTC, a machine known as machine_splitter01 executed a splitting process that lasted approximately 6.69 seconds. This operation processed a steel coil (ID: o_steelcoil_1, mass: 31.91076 kg) and produced a steel sheet (ID: o_steelsheet_4479) with a mass of 0.0213 kg. The emissions for this process were recorded at 0.0070029786 kg of CO2 equivalent, with electricity consumption of 0.0102252 kWh from the grid and generation of 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

4. Shortly after, at 07:43:57 UTC, a heating process for another steel sheet (ID: o_steelsheet_4474) occurred at Workstation[o_workstation_1]. This heating lasted 900 seconds, producing 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 emissions, with energy consumption recorded at 0.02 kWh and a gas input of 0.49392 Wh, leading to a similar burn emission of 0.49392 Wh. The steel sheet had a mass of 0.02118 kg.

These events illustrate the sequence of operations involving both heating and splitting processes at Workstation[o_workstation_1], demonstrating the relationships between the machines and objects involved in producing and processing steel sheets and coils.
