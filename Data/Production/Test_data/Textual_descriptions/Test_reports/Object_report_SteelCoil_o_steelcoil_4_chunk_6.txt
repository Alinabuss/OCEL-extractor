**Report for Object o_steelcoil_4**

On April 3, 2023, several splitting operations were conducted involving the steel coil identified as o_steelcoil_4, which has a mass of 31.91076 kg. All processes took place at Workstation[1], utilizing the machine labeled as Machine[splitter01].

1. The first operation occurred at 10:53:13 UTC, lasting approximately 14.7159 seconds. This resulted in a steel sheet identified as o_steelsheet_923, weighing 0.02117 kg. During this process, 0.015387 kg of CO2 equivalent was emitted, and 0.0224826 kWh of electricity was consumed from the grid. A small quantity of steel waste, measured at 0.00042 kg, was earmarked for recycling.

2. The second event took place at 10:59:09 UTC, with a duration of roughly 13.95 seconds. This operation yielded a steel sheet labeled SteelSheet[948], weighing 0.02102 kg. CO2 emissions for this task amounted to 0.0145868286 kg, and the energy usage was 0.0213127 kWh. Additionally, 0.00042 kg of steel waste was designated for recycling.

3. The third operation was conducted at 11:01:31 UTC, lasting about 14.29 seconds. This operation produced a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[958], with a mass of 0.02112 kg. It generated 0.01494 kg of CO2 emissions and consumed 0.0218294 kWh from the grid. The process also recorded 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

4. The fourth event occurred at 11:04:37 UTC and took approximately 13.77 seconds. This process produced a steel sheet registered as SteelSheet[971], weighing 0.02103 kg. During this operation, 0.0144 kg of CO2 equivalent was emitted, and 0.021044 kWh of electricity was consumed from the grid. Again, 0.00042 kg of steel waste was allocated for recycling.

5. Finally, at 11:06:04 UTC, another splitting operation lasted approximately 14.34 seconds, resulting in a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[977], which weighed 0.02104 kg. This process emitted 0.015 kg of CO2 equivalent and consumed about 0.022 kWh of electricity. The operation also marked 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

In summary, across these five operations, o_steelcoil_4 was consistently involved in the splitting processes, generating various steel sheets while concurrently producing CO2 emissions and consuming electricity, all with the consistent recycling of negligible steel waste.
