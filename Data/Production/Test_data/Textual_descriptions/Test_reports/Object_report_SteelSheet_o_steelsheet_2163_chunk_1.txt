On April 4, 2023, at 09:56:05 UTC, a machine identified as Machine[Splitter01] processed a SteelCoil with ID SteelCoil[3] at Workstation[1]. This operation resulted in the creation of a SteelSheet with ID SteelSheet[2163]. The splitting process took approximately 14.502 seconds and generated a carbon dioxide equivalent emission of 0.01516 kg. Additionally, it consumed 0.022156 kWh of electricity from the grid and produced a negligible amount of steel waste, specifically 0.00042 kg, for recycling. The SteelSheet[2163] was directly derived from the SteelCoil[3], indicating a clear relationship between these objects.
