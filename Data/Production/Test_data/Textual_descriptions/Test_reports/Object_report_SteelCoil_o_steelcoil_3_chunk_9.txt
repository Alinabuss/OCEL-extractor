**Report for Object o_steelcoil_3:**

On April 4, 2023, a series of events occurred involving the steel coil identified as o_steelcoil_3, which has a mass of 31.91076 kg. 

1. The first operation took place at 11:56:58 UTC at workstation o_workstation_1, using the machine o_machine_splitter01. This process, lasting approximately 14.30 seconds, resulted in the creation of a steel sheet, o_steelsheet_2672, weighing 0.02125 kg. During this time, 0.01495 kg of CO2 equivalent was emitted, and 0.02184 kWh of electricity was consumed from the grid, along with the generation of 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

2. Subsequently, at 12:03:09 UTC, the same machine, now designated Machine[splitter01], operated again at Workstation[1]. This operation also involved the production of a steel sheet, SteelSheet[2698], with a mass of 0.02125 kg, from the same steel coil. The splitting process took approximately 14.29 seconds and consumed 0.0218355 kWh of electricity, emitting 0.0149444238 kg of CO2. As before, 0.00042 kg of steel waste was produced for recycling.

3. At 12:10:59 UTC, the machine known as Splitter01 operated at Workstation 1, further splitting the steel coil to create a new steel sheet identified as SteelSheet2731, which had a mass of 0.02107 kg. This split lasted approximately 14.59978 seconds, resulting in CO2 emissions of 0.0152656986 kg and the consumption of 0.0223052 kWh of electricity from the grid, alongside 0.00042 kg of steel waste earmarked for recycling. 

4. The next split occurred at 12:14:18 UTC, generating another steel sheet, SteelSheet[2745]. This operation, utilizing the same machine and workstation, lasted approximately 14.085 seconds, emitting 0.01473 kg of CO2 and consuming 0.02152 kWh of electricity, with an additional generation of 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

5. Finally, at 12:17:37 UTC, a steel sheet with a mass of 0.02112 kg was produced from the steel coil in another operation. This process lasted approximately 14.13 seconds, generating 0.014776 kg of CO2 emissions and consuming 0.0215894 kWh of electricity, alongside the ongoing production of 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling. 

Throughout these events, the relationship between the steel coil o_steelcoil_3 and the resulting steel sheets is evident, showcasing its role as the primary material in each instance.
