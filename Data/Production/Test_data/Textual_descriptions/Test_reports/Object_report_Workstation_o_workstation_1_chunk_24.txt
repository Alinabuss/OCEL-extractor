**Report for Object o_workstation_1:**

On April 4, 2023, multiple heating and processing activities occurred at workstation ID "o_workstation_1" involving various steel sheets and machines.

1. At **09:50:42 UTC**, heating was performed on a steel sheet with ID **o_steelsheet_2136**, weighing **0.02111 kg**. The process, using machine ID **o_machine_oven01**, lasted **900 seconds** and emitted **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2 equivalent. The operation consumed **0.02 kWh** of electricity and utilized a gas input of **0.49392 Wh**, with equivalent emissions from burning also recorded at **0.49392 Wh**.

2. Shortly after, at **09:54:16 UTC**, machine **oven01** at workstation **o_workstation_1** heated another steel sheet, this time with ID **SteelSheet[2151]** and a mass of **0.02126 kg**. This heating process also lasted for **900 seconds**, producing **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2 equivalent, **0.02 kWh** of electricity from the grid, and utilized **0.49392 Wh** of gas, mirroring the emissions from burning at the same value.

3. At **09:56:05 UTC**, machine **Splitter01** processed a SteelCoil with ID **SteelCoil[3]**, resulting in the creation of a new SteelSheet with ID **SteelSheet[2163]**. This procedure, which took approximately **14.502 seconds**, generated **0.01516 kg** of CO2 equivalent emissions, consumed **0.022156 kWh** from the grid, and produced a negligible amount of steel waste for recycling (0.00042 kg). This event illustrates the creation of SteelSheet[2163] directly from SteelCoil[3].

4. Another heating operation took place at **09:59:25 UTC** at workstation **o_workstation_1**, where a steel sheet identified as **SteelSheet[2173]** and weighing **0.02104 kg** was processed. This heating, using machine **o_machine_oven01**, lasted **900 seconds**, emitting **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2 equivalent, while consuming **0.02 kWh** of grid electricity and **0.49392 Wh** of gas input, also recording equivalent emissions from burning at **0.49392 Wh**.

5. Finally, at **10:02:41 UTC**, another steel sheet, this one with ID **o_steelsheet_2187** and a mass of **0.02101 kg**, underwent heating at workstation **o_workstation_1**. The duration for this process was **900 seconds**, and it emitted **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2 equivalent. Similar to previous operations, it consumed **0.02 kWh** of electricity and utilized **0.49392 Wh** of gas input, again facilitated by machine **o_machine_oven01**, which was actively part of this heating operation.

All heating processes and operations were executed with attention to energy consumption and emissions, consistent across the different steel sheets and machines involved at the specified workstation.
