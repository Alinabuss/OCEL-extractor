**Report for Object: o_machine_splitter01**

On April 5, 2023, the machine identified as **o_machine_splitter01** operated at **Workstation[1]** for multiple steel splitting processes. 

1. At **09:17:26 UTC**, it split a steel coil with the ID **SteelCoil[2]** into a steel sheet labeled **SteelSheet[3479]**. The operation lasted approximately **14.28 seconds** and produced a steel sheet weighing **0.02121 kg**. During this process, it emitted **0.01493 kg** of CO2 and utilized **0.02181 kWh** of electricity. A small amount of steel waste, weighing **0.00042 kg**, was designated for recycling.

2. At **09:19:06 UTC**, the machine again processed a steel coil, referred to as **o_steelcoil_2**, which weighed **31.91076 kg**, resulting in the output steel sheet labeled **o_steelsheet_3486** with a mass of **0.0209 kg**. This operation lasted approximately **14.94 seconds** and generated **0.01562 kg** of CO2 emissions, alongside **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling. The energy consumption for this process was **0.02282 kWh**.

3. At **09:40:47 UTC**, the machine operated using the same steel coil ID **o_steelcoil_2** for another splitting task, resulting in a steel sheet labeled **o_steelsheet_3577** weighing **0.0212 kg**. This operation lasted around **13.91 seconds**, emitting **0.01454 kg** of CO2 equivalent and producing **0.00042 kg** of steel waste. 

4. At **09:49:52 UTC**, the machine performed another split at **Workstation 1**, resulting in a steel sheet weighing **0.02105 kg**. The operation continued for approximately **13.79 seconds**, with emissions of **0.01442 kg** of CO2. It consumed **0.02106 kWh** of electricity and produced **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling, using a steel coil weighing **31.91076 kg**.

5. Finally, at **09:54:23 UTC**, the machine conducted a split operation at **Workstation[1]**, again involving the steel coil **SteelCoil[2]** weighing **31.91076 kg**. The output was labeled **SteelSheet[3634]** with a mass of **0.02115 kg**. This split took approximately **14.30 seconds**, emitting **0.01495 kg** of CO2 and consuming **0.02185 kWh** of electric energy, alongside producing **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling.

Overall, o_machine_splitter01 played a crucial role in these series of operations, producing multiple sheets from the same steel coils while generating emissions and waste to be recycled, and consuming energy throughout.
