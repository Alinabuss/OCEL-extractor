### Event Report for Object o_workstation_1

On April 6, 2023, several operations were performed at the workstation identified as o_workstation_1.

1. **Split Operation - 12:44:11 UTC**  
   The machine named Splitter01 conducted a split operation on SteelCoil[1], producing SteelSheet[5826]. This operation lasted approximately 14.37 seconds, emitting 0.015 kg of CO2 equivalent and generating 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling. The process consumed 0.02195 kWh of electricity from the grid.

2. **Heating Operation - 12:45:48 UTC**  
   A heating process was executed on a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_5829, which weighed 0.02128 kg. This heating lasted for 900 seconds, resulting in an emission of 0.01380 kg of CO2 equivalent. The machine used was identified as o_machine_oven01. The operation consumed 0.02 kWh of electricity from the grid and involved gas input of 0.49392 Wh, which also resulted in an equivalent emission of 0.49392 Wh.

3. **Heating Operation - 12:46:02 UTC**  
   Another steel sheet, with ID o_steelsheet_5830 and weighing 0.02113 kg, was heated. The operation lasted 900 seconds, consuming 0.02 kWh of grid electricity and involving a gas input of 0.49392 Wh. The emission recorded was 0.01380 kg of CO2 equivalent, with the burn emission also at 0.49392 Wh. This was conducted using the machine o_machine_oven01 at o_workstation_1.

4. **Split Operation - 12:46:04 UTC**  
   At the same workstation, Splitter01 performed another split operation on SteelCoil[1], resulting in SteelSheet[5834]. This operation took approximately 14.41 seconds and generated 0.01506 kg of CO2 equivalent and 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling, utilizing 0.02201 kWh of electricity from the grid.

5. **Heating Operation - 12:46:34 UTC**  
   A steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[5832], weighing 0.02119 kg, underwent heating. This process lasted for 900 seconds and resulted in emissions of 0.01380 kg of CO2. The operation was executed using Machine[oven01] at Workstation[1], consuming 0.02 kWh of electricity and featuring a gas input of 0.49392 Wh, with a corresponding burn emission of 0.49392 Wh.

These operations reflect the various processing activities involving splitting and heating steel sheets at o_workstation_1 on April 6, 2023.
