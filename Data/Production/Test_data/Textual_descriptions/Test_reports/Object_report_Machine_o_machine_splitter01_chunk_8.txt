**Report Summary for Object o_machine_splitter01**

On April 3, 2023, the machine identified as o_machine_splitter01, located at workstation o_workstation_1, executed multiple processes involving the splitting of steel sheets derived from the same steel coil, o_steelcoil_4, which weighed 31.91076 kg.

1. The first operation occurred at 11:43:07 UTC, lasting 13.8485891584 seconds. This process produced a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_1133, weighing 0.02115 kg. It resulted in CO2 emissions of 0.0144807402 kg, consumed 0.0211576 kWh from the grid, and generated 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

2. At 11:52:13 UTC, another splitting operation was performed taking approximately 13.62 seconds. This produced an output steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[1171], which weighed 0.02109 kg. It emitted 0.01425 kg of CO2 equivalent, utilized 0.02081 kWh of electrical energy, and generated 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

3. The third event took place at 12:01:44 UTC, lasting around 13.76 seconds. This process resulted in the creation of steel sheet o_steelsheet_1211, which weighed 0.02126 kg. The operation produced CO2 emissions of 0.01439 kg, consumed 0.0210254 kWh of electricity, and also generated 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

4. The fourth operation happened at 12:29:05 UTC, known as SplitSteelSheet, which recorded a duration of approximately 14.3085 seconds. This generated a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_1326, weighing 0.02107 kg, resulting in CO2 emissions of 0.0149613 kg, while consuming 0.0218602 kWh and producing 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

5. Finally, at 12:34:05 UTC, the machine executed another task, taking approximately 14.6901008056 seconds. It yielded a steel sheet identified as steelsheet_1347 with a mass of 0.02127 kg. The process emitted 0.0153600906 kg of CO2, consumed 0.0224432 kWh of electric energy, and produced 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

Overall, throughout these operations, the machine o_machine_splitter01 effectively processed steel sheets with output weights varying slightly, while consistently utilizing o_steelcoil_4, and generating similar levels of CO2 emissions and steel waste.
