**Report for Object: o_machine_oven01**

On April 3, 2023, the machine with ID o_machine_oven01, located at workstation ID o_workstation_1, was involved in a series of heating processes on various steel sheets. 

1. At **10:45:53 UTC**, the machine heated a steel sheet with ID **o_steelsheet_888**, weighing **0.02108 kg**. This operation lasted **900 seconds**, producing **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2 emissions. The electric energy consumed was **0.02 kWh**, with a gas input of **0.49392 Wh**, mirrored by emissions from burning.

2. Soon after, at **10:46:49 UTC**, a second heating process took place on a steel sheet with ID **o_steelsheet_892**. This process also lasted **900 seconds** and resulted in the same amount of emissions, **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2e, and energy consumption of **0.02 kWh**. The gas input and emissions from burning remained consistent at **0.49392 Wh**.

3. The next heating event occurred at **10:48:30 UTC**, where the machine processed a steel sheet identified as **SteelSheet[899]**, again for **900 seconds**. This resulted in **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2 equivalent emissions, with energy consumption recorded at **0.02 kWh** and gas input at **0.49392 Wh**.

4. Another operation was recorded at **10:59:37 UTC** for the steel sheet **SteelSheet[946]**, which weighed **0.02127 kg**. The heating lasted **900 seconds**, yielding **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2 equivalent emissions. This operation involved an electric consumption of **0.02 kWh**, with gas input and emissions from burning both reported as **0.49392 Wh**.

5. Lastly, at **11:04:39 UTC**, the machine processed a steel sheet with ID **o_steelsheet_967**, which had a mass of **0.02116 kg**. The heating lasted **900 seconds** and emitted **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2e. The energy consumption from the grid was **0.02 kWh**, and gas input and burning emissions were again noted at **0.49392 Wh**.

Throughout these operations, the consistency in emissions and energy consumption highlights the efficiency and reliability of the machine o_machine_oven01 in the heating processes conducted on April 3, 2023.
