On April 3, 2023, several heating processes and a part formation occurred at workstation ID o_workstation_1, using machine ID o_machine_oven01.

At 12:26:57 UTC, a heating process was performed on a steel sheet ID o_steelsheet_1313, weighing 0.02109 kg. This operation lasted 900 seconds, generating emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent. During this time, the machine consumed 0.02 kWh from the electric grid, alongside a gas input of 0.49392 Wh, with burn emissions also recorded at 0.49392 Wh.

Following this, at 12:29:20 UTC, another heating process was conducted on a steel sheet ID o_steelsheet_1323, which had a mass of 0.02134 kg. This operation, similarly lasting 900 seconds, resulted in emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 and recorded energy consumption of 0.02 kWh from the grid, along with a gas input and burn emissions of 0.49392 Wh each.

At 12:39:59 UTC, a heating operation for a steel sheet ID o_steelsheet_1368, weighing 0.02123 kg, took place. This process also lasted 900 seconds and emitted 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 while consuming 0.02 kWh from the electric grid, along with a gas input and burn emissions of 0.49392 Wh each.

Later, at 12:42:50 UTC, a formed part was created from steel sheet ID SteelSheet[1311] (mass: 0.02122 kg) at workstation[1]. The formation took 5.0 seconds and resulted in a carbon footprint of 0.0028500228 kg CO2e. Machine labeled Machine[former02] was used, consuming 0.0041667 kWh from the electric grid. The created formed part is identified as FormedPart[1311].

Finally, at 12:59:32 UTC, another heating process occurred, this time for steel sheet ID SteelSheet[1450], which weighed 0.02119 kg. This process, lasting 900 seconds in machine Oven01 at workstation Workstation[1], resulted in emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2, with energy consumption recorded at 0.02 kWh from the grid and gas input and emissions of 0.49392 Wh each.
