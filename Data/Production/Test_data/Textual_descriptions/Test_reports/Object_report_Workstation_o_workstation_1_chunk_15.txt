**Combined Report for Object o_workstation_1**

On April 3, 2023, at workstation identified as "workstation_1", several operations involving steel splitting were conducted using a machine referred to as "splitter01". 

1. At **12:34:05 UTC**, the machine split a steel sheet, producing steel sheet "steelsheet_1347" weighing **0.02127 kg** from steel coil "steelcoil_4" (weighing **31.91076 kg**). This operation lasted approximately **14.69 seconds**, resulting in **0.0153600906 kg** of CO2 emissions and generating **0.00042 kg** of steel waste intended for recycling, with an electricity consumption of **0.0224432 kWh**.

2. At **12:34:19 UTC**, a similar operation was performed, yielding steel sheet "steelsheet_1348" that weighed **0.02121 kg**, also derived from steel coil "steelcoil_4". This splitting process took about **13.83 seconds**, leading to CO2 emissions of **0.01446 kg**, and the consumption of **0.02112 kWh** of electricity. The operation produced a negligible steel waste of **0.00042 kg** for recycling.

3. Later, at **12:45:29 UTC**, another splitting operation took place on steel coil "SteelCoil[4]", resulting in the creation of steel sheet "SteelSheet[1395]". This task lasted around **14.48 seconds**, generating **0.0151 kg** of CO2 emissions while consuming **0.0221 kWh** of electric energy. A small steel waste of **0.00042 kg** was also produced for recycling.

4. At **12:53:36 UTC**, "Machine[splitter01]" executed a similar task producing steel sheet "SteelSheet[1429]" from steel coil "SteelCoil[4]". The operation's duration was approximately **14.1 seconds** with CO2 emissions recorded at **0.0147 kg** and electric consumption at **0.0215 kWh**. As with previous operations, **0.00042 kg** of steel waste was earmarked for recycling.

5. Finally, at **12:55:17 UTC**, the machine performed another splitting process, resulting in steel sheet "steel sheet 1436" weighing **0.02116 kg**, crafted from the same coil, "steel coil 4". This operation lasted **14.7049 seconds**, producing **0.0154 kg** of carbon dioxide emissions and consuming **0.0225 kWh** of electricity, accompanied by **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling.

Throughout these operations, the consistent use of "steelcoil_4" and the recurring generation of negligible steel waste affirm a systematic process at "workstation_1" during that day.
