**Report for Object: o_steelcoil_1**

On April 6, 2023, the steel coil identified as **o_steelcoil_1**, weighing 31.91076 kg, was involved in several consecutive events across multiple operations at Workstation[1], utilizing the machine **splitter01**.

1. The first operation occurred at **10:33:26 UTC**, where **splitter01** performed a split on a steel sheet. This process lasted approximately **14.36 seconds**, resulting in a new steel sheet weighing **0.02108 kg** and producing **0.015016107 kg** of CO2 emissions. The machine consumed **0.0219403 kWh** of electricity and generated **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling.

2. Shortly after, at **10:45:16 UTC**, the same machine **splitter01** executed another splitting operation, resulting in a steel sheet designated as **steelsheet_5325**, with a mass of **0.02104 kg**. This process lasted about **13.9 seconds**, emitting **0.01454 kg** of CO2 and consuming **0.02124 kWh** of electricity, while also producing **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling.

3. The third event took place at **10:55:28 UTC**, where **Workstation[1]** facilitated the **SplitSteelSheet** process. This operation produced the steel sheet identified as **SteelSheet[5368]**, weighing **0.02111 kg**, and had similar resource consumption: a splitting duration of **14.43 seconds**, **0.0151 kg** of CO2 emissions, **0.022 kWh** of electricity, and **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling.

4. At **10:56:40 UTC**, **Machine[splitter01]** executed another split, resulting in **SteelSheet[5373]** with a mass of **0.02123 kg**. This operation lasted **14.2 seconds**, generated **0.014851 kg** of CO2 emissions, and consumed **0.0216987 kWh** of electricity, along with the same negligible waste output of **0.00042 kg** earmarked for recycling.

5. Finally, at **10:57:37 UTC**, the machine referred to as **o_machine_splitter01** split a steel sheet identified as **o_steelsheet_5377**. This task took approximately **14.19 seconds**, yielding a sheet weighing **0.02096 kg**. The emissions for this event were **0.01484 kg** of CO2, and it consumed **0.0216812 kWh** of electricity, alongside another **0.00042 kg** of steel waste intended for recycling.

Throughout these operations, the consistent use of **o_steelcoil_1** has resulted in numerous outputs, demonstrating its role in continuous production efforts.
