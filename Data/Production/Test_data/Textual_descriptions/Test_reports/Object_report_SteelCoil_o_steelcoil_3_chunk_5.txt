**Summary Report for Object o_steelcoil_3**

On April 4, 2023, a series of operations were conducted involving the steel coil identified as SteelCoil[3], which has a mass of 31.91076 kg, across multiple instances at Workstation[1] using Machine[Splitter01].

1. **First Operation**: At 09:16:59 UTC, Machine[Splitter01] processed SteelCoil[3] to produce SteelSheet[1998], which weighed 0.02127 kg. This operation lasted 13.828 seconds, generating 0.014459673 kg of CO2 emissions and consuming 0.0211268 kWh of electricity. Additionally, it directed 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

2. **Second Operation**: Shortly after, at 09:26:56 UTC, Workstation[1] initiated the splitting of SteelSheet[2040] using SteelCoil[3]. This process took approximately 13.61 seconds, producing a steel sheet weighing 0.02124 kg, while consuming 0.0207966 kWh of electric energy and emitting 0.0142338162 kg of CO2. A negligible amount of steel waste, 0.00042 kg, was also directed for recycling.

3. **Third Operation**: At 09:46:11 UTC, the machine (splitter01) again processed a steel sheet, resulting in the creation of SteelSheet[2121]. This operation lasted 15.1 seconds, emitting 0.01579 kg of CO2 equivalent and consuming 0.02307 kWh from the grid. The steel sheet weighed 0.02097 kg, with 0.00042 kg of steel waste also directed for recycling.

4. **Fourth Operation**: Later, at 09:56:05 UTC, Machine[Splitter01] processed SteelCoil[3] to create SteelSheet[2163] in a process that lasted 14.502 seconds. The operation resulted in 0.01516 kg of CO2 emissions and consumed 0.022156 kWh of electricity, with 0.00042 kg of steel waste allocated for recycling.

5. **Fifth Operation**: Finally, at 10:17:50 UTC, another splitting operation occurred at Workstation[1], again utilizing Machine[Splitter01] and SteelCoil[3]. This activity lasted around 13.68 seconds, producing SteelSheet[2255] weighing 0.02113 kg, while consuming 0.0209 kWh of electric energy and generating 0.0143 kg of CO2 emissions, alongside 0.00042 kg of steel waste directed for recycling.

Throughout these events, SteelCoil[3] was consistently linked to multiple steel sheets as a key raw material, demonstrating its integral role in the operations.
