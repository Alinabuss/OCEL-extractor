On April 4, 2023, several operations took place involving the machine identified as "o_machine_cutter01" at Workstation ID "o_workstation_2" and various male parts.

At 08:58:33 UTC, "o_machine_cutter01" performed a cutting operation on a male part with ID "o_malepart_1604," resulting in a formed part identified as "o_formedpart_1604." The process lasted approximately 10.03 seconds and consumed about 0.0153 kWh of electricity, along with 0.071 m³ of compressed air and 0.061 m³ of nitrogen gas, which was also emitted. The operation generated a carbon dioxide equivalent of 0.0741 kg.

Shortly after, at 09:04:59 UTC, a different machine, "Machine[former02]," operated at Workstation[1] to form a steel sheet with ID "SteelSheet[1876]" from an input mass of 0.02128 kg. This process took 5 seconds and created a formed part identified as "FormedPart[1876],” generating emissions of 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 and consuming 0.0041667 kWh of electricity.

At 09:09:04 UTC, "o_machine_cutter01" was again utilized for cutting a male part with ID "o_malepart_1567." The cutting lasted approximately 10.05 seconds, producing an output labeled as "o_formedpart_1567." This operation also took place at Workstation ID "o_workstation_2." The machine consumed approximately 0.0153583 kWh of electric energy and utilized 0.05 m³ of compressed air and 0.061 m³ of nitrogen gas, with emissions matching the nitrogen gas usage. The carbon dioxide equivalent generated was 0.0628824860889 kg, while the steel waste quantity from the operation remained unspecified.

Later, at 09:21:03 UTC, "o_machine_cutter01" was again engaged in a cutting operation at Workstation ID "o_workstation_2,” producing a male part with ID "o_malepart_1487" from an input formed part with ID "o_formedpart_1487." This process lasted approximately 9.88 seconds, consuming 0.015 kWh of electricity, 0.064 m³ of compressed air, and 0.06 m³ of nitrogen gas, which was also emitted. The operation resulted in carbon dioxide equivalent emissions totaling 0.067 kg, with the weight of generated steel waste still unspecified.

Finally, at 09:38:03 UTC, another cutting operation occurred at Workstation ID "o_workstation_2," again utilizing "o_machine_cutter01." This process resulted in a formed part with ID "o_formedpart_1657" from a male part identified as "o_malepart_1657." Lasting approximately 9.89 seconds, the operation produced 0.0636 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions. It consumed 0.0151 kWh of electricity, 0.056 m³ of compressed air, and 0.06 m³ of nitrogen gas, which was emitted back into the atmosphere. As with previous operations, the mass of steel waste generated remains unspecified.
