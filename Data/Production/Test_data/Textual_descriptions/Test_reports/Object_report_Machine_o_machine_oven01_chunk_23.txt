**Report for Object: o_machine_oven01**

On April 6, 2023, o_machine_oven01 was utilized in a series of heating processes at workstation ID o_workstation_1. 

1. **Event 1**: At 08:29:42 UTC, a heat treatment was conducted on steel sheet SteelSheet[4749], which weighed 0.02105 kg. This process lasted for 900 seconds, resulting in carbon dioxide emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg. The operation consumed 0.02 kWh of electricity from the grid and used gas input of 0.49392 Wh, with equivalent carbon emissions also recorded at 0.49392 Wh.

2. **Event 2**: At 08:31:50 UTC, a heating process took place on steel sheet ID o_steelsheet_4758. This heating, lasting 900 seconds, resulted in 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions. It also consumed 0.02 kWh of electric energy from the grid and drew gas input of 0.49392 Wh, which produced an equivalent emission during the burn of 0.49392 Wh.

3. **Event 3**: At 08:32:44 UTC, another heating process was carried out on steel sheet ID o_steelsheet_4762, with a mass of 0.02118 kg. This event, lasting 900 seconds, produced emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent. The operation required 0.02 kWh of electricity and utilized gas input of 0.49392 Wh, resulting in an additional burn emission also recorded at 0.49392 Wh.

4. **Event 4**: At 08:32:58 UTC, o_machine_oven01 was again involved in heating steel sheet SteelSheet[4763] for 900 seconds. The process emitted approximately 0.0138 kg of CO2 equivalent, consumed 0.02 kWh of grid electricity, and had a gas input of 0.49392 Wh, leading to the same emission of 0.49392 Wh during burning.

5. **Event 5**: Finally, at 08:37:58 UTC, a heat treatment was performed on steel sheet ID o_steelsheet_4784, weighing 0.02117 kg. This treatment lasted for 900 seconds, producing emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent, consuming 0.02 kWh of electricity and gas input of 0.49392 Wh, with an emissions equivalent during the burn also recorded at 0.49392 Wh.

All processes demonstrate the consistent use of o_machine_oven01 for heating steel sheets, with similar energy consumption and emissions profiles throughout the different events.
