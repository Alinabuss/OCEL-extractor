**Report for Object: o_steelcoil_1**

On April 6, 2023, the steel coil with ID o_steelcoil_1, weighing 31.91076 kg, was involved in multiple processing events at workstation o_workstation_1 using machine o_machine_splitter01.

1. **First Event:** At 11:28:48 UTC, a split operation was executed on a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_5508, weighing 0.02121 kg. The splitting process lasted approximately 14.395 seconds, resulting in CO2 emissions of 0.0150518118 kg and an electricity consumption of 0.0219925 kWh. Additionally, 0.00042 kg of steel waste was produced for recycling.

2. **Second Event:** Shortly thereafter, at 11:40:57 UTC, the machine known as Splitter01 carried out another split operation. This event lasted for around 13.99 seconds and generated 0.02108 kg of steel sheet from the same steel coil. The operation resulted in 0.014626911 kg of CO2 emissions and consumed 0.0213713 kWh of electricity, while also creating 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

3. **Third Event:** Another split took place at 11:57:32 UTC, continuing the processing of o_steelcoil_1. This operation involved a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[5629], weighing 0.02147 kg. It lasted for approximately 13.84 seconds, emitting about 0.0144719166 kg of CO2 and requiring 0.0211447 kWh of electricity. Like previous events, 0.00042 kg of steel waste was generated for recycling.

4. **Fourth Event:** At 12:11:29 UTC, another steel sheet was processed at o_workstation_1. This operation produced the steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_5688, weighing 0.02106 kg, and lasted approximately 13.88 seconds, resulting in 0.0145 kg of CO2 emissions and the generation of 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

5. **Fifth Event:** The final event recorded was on the same day at 12:16:53 UTC. Machine splitter01 processed the steel coil, producing a steel sheet with ID steelsheet_5711, weighing 0.02125 kg. This operation took around 13.785 seconds, emitting approximately 0.014414 kg of CO2 and consuming 0.0210607 kWh from the grid, while also generating a negligible amount of steel waste, again amounting to 0.00042 kg.

Throughout these operations, o_steelcoil_1 was consistently linked to the generation of multiple steel sheets and demonstrated efficient processing with controlled emissions and waste management.
