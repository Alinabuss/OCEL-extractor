**Report for Object: o_workstation_1**

On April 6, 2023, at 10:49:02 UTC, a heating process was executed at workstation o_workstation_1 on a steel sheet identified as o_steelsheet_5337, weighing 0.02116 kg. This operation, associated with machine ID o_machine_oven01, lasted for 900 seconds and consumed 0.02 kilowatt-hours of electricity, alongside 0.49392 watt-hours of gas input, resulting in emissions of 0.49392 watt-hours of burned gas and approximately 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent.

Later, at 10:55:28 UTC, the workstation performed a splitting operation known as SplitSteelSheet. This process took about 14.43 seconds, generating a steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[5368] weighing 0.02111 kg, produced from a steel coil with ID SteelCoil[1] weighing 31.91076 kg. The process also led to the emission of 0.0151 kg of CO2, consumed 0.022 kWh of electricity, and produced approximately 0.00042 kg of steel waste.

At 10:56:40 UTC, the workstation was again utilized, this time for another splitting task performed by machine ID Machine[splitter01]. The output was a steel sheet (SteelSheet[5373]) created from the same steel coil (SteelCoil[1]). This splitting process ran for about 14.2 seconds, resulting in 0.014851 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions and consumed 0.0216987 kWh of electricity, with a negligible steel waste of 0.00042 kg.

Subsequently, at 10:57:37 UTC, machine o_machine_splitter01 operated at workstation o_workstation_1 to split a steel sheet identified as o_steelsheet_5377 from the same steel coil o_steelcoil_1. This process lasted for approximately 14.19 seconds, yielding 0.02096 kg of steel sheet and producing 0.01484 kg of CO2 emissions, while using 0.0216812 kWh of electricity and generating 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

Finally, at 10:58:20 UTC, another steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[5380], weighing 0.02117 kg, was created from the same steel coil (SteelCoil[1]). This cutting operation required 13.825 seconds, emitting 0.0144564582 kg of CO2, consuming 0.0211221 kWh of electricity, and produced 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

Overall, during this series of operations, o_workstation_1 processed steel coils and sheets, utilized various machines, and emitted considerable CO2 while generating minimal waste.
