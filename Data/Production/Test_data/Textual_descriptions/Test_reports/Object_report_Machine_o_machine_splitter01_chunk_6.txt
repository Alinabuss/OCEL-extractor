**Report for Object o_machine_splitter01**

On April 3, 2023, multiple splitting operations utilizing the machine o_machine_splitter01 occurred at Workstation[1].

1. **Event 1**: At 10:53:13 UTC, the machine engaged in a splitting process involving steel coil ID o_steelcoil_4, weighing 31.91076 kg. The operation lasted approximately 14.7159 seconds, outputting steel sheet o_steelsheet_923 with a mass of 0.02117 kg. This process emitted 0.015387 kg of CO2 equivalent and consumed 0.0224826 kWh of electricity, while generating 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

2. **Event 2**: At 10:59:09 UTC, another operation took place using the same steel coil with a mass of 31.91076 kg. This event lasted around 13.95 seconds and produced steel sheet SteelSheet[948], which weighed 0.02102 kg. The operation emitted 0.0145868286 kg of CO2 equivalent and required 0.0213127 kWh from the grid, with 0.00042 kg of steel waste also earmarked for recycling.

3. **Event 3**: At 11:01:31 UTC, the machine executed another splitting operation involving steel coil SteelCoil[4] (mass: 31.91076 kg). This process took approximately 14.29 seconds, generating steel sheet SteelSheet[958] weighing 0.02112 kg. Emissions from this operation totaled 0.01494 kg of CO2, and energy consumption was at 0.0218294 kWh, with 0.00042 kg of steel waste noted for recycling.

4. **Event 4**: At 11:04:37 UTC, the machine performed yet another splitting operation using steel coil SteelCoil[4]. The process lasted about 13.77 seconds and produced steel sheet SteelSheet[971] with a mass of 0.02103 kg. This operation emitted 0.0144 kg of CO2 equivalents, consumed 0.021044 kWh, and recorded 0.00042 kg of recycling steel waste.

5. **Event 5**: Lastly, at 11:06:04 UTC, a splitting operation resulted in the creation of steel sheet SteelSheet[977] from steel coil SteelCoil[4]. This event took approximately 14.34 seconds, releasing 0.015 kg of CO2 equivalent and utilizing around 0.022 kWh of electricity. Similar to the previous events, it generated 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

All operations consistently utilized the same steel coil feeding multiple outputs, each conducted at Workstation[1] with minimal CO2 emissions and a consistent low level of recycling waste.
