On April 3, 2023, several significant operations were conducted across different workstations. 

At 10:01:16 UTC, a machine labeled Machine[former02], located at Workstation[1], processed a SteelSheet[631] weighing 0.02108 kg, transforming it into a FormedPart[631]. This operation, which lasted for 5.0 seconds, consumed approximately 0.0041667 kWh from the grid and emitted 0.0028500228 kg of CO2. The formed part was directly created from the steel sheet used in this process.

Shortly after, at 10:04:31 UTC, the coating process was initiated for a formed part identified as FormedPart[643] at Workstation[1], utilizing Machine[coater03]. This operation took 300 seconds, applied 0.0004 kg of coating material, and wasted 0.0001 kg of coating material. The machine consumed 0.25 kWh of electricity during this time and emitted approximately 0.175 kg of CO2 equivalent.

At 10:05:40 UTC, the processing of a SteelSheet[652] weighing 0.0213 kg took place, also resulting in the creation of a formed part identified as FormedPart[652]. Conducted on Machine[former02] at Workstation[1], this operation lasted for 5 seconds, consumed 0.0041667 kWh, and produced approximately 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 emissions.

Following this, at 10:06:52 UTC, Machine[01] was employed at Workstation[2] to perform the cutting of a male part identified as MalePart[403]. This cutting operation lasted around 9.94 seconds, emitted 0.07488 kg of CO2 equivalents, and consumed 0.01518 kWh of electricity. Additional resources were required, including 0.076 m続 of compressed air and 0.061 m続 of nitrogen gas, which was also emitted during the process. The male part that was cut originated from FormedPart[403].

Finally, at 10:12:30 UTC, a cutting process for a male part was carried out at Workstation[2] using Machine[cutter01]. This operation produced a male part with ID MalePart[328], processing the input FormedPart[328]. The duration of this task was approximately 10.11 seconds, with emissions of 0.07107 kg of CO2 equivalent. It consumed 0.0154422 kWh of electricity, utilized 0.065 m続 of compressed air, and released 0.062 m続 of nitrogen gas into the atmosphere. The mass of steel waste produced during this cutting procedure was not specified. 

Overall, the interconnected operations across Workstation[1] and Workstation[2] on this date highlight the efficient transformations and emissions linked to the manufacturing processes occurring throughout the day.
