### Summary Report for Object o_workstation_1

On April 4, 2023, multiple operations were conducted at Workstation[1] (ID: o_workstation_1) involving various steel sheets and machines.

1. **Heating Process of Steel Sheet[1836**: At 08:39:33 UTC, the heating process commenced for SteelSheet[1836]. This lasted 900 seconds and utilized Machine[oven01]. The operation consumed 0.02 kWh of electricity and 0.49392 Wh of gas, generating a CO2 equivalent emission of 0.0138019093344 kg and additional emissions of 0.49392 Wh due to burning.

2. **Splitting Process of Steel Sheet**: Shortly after, at 08:43:45 UTC, a new steel sheet, identified as o_steelsheet_1858 (weight: 0.02102 kg), was produced from a steel coil (ID: o_steelcoil_3, mass: 31.91076 kg) using Machine[o_machine_splitter01] at the same workstation. This splitting operation lasted 14.502 seconds, required 0.0221561 kWh of electricity, produced a CO2 equivalent emission of 0.0151637142 kg, and generated 0.00042 kg of negligible steel waste.

3. **Heating Process of Steel Sheet[1884]**: At 08:50:51 UTC, another heating process took place for SteelSheet[1884] at Workstation[1] using Machine[oven01]. This heating session lasted 900 seconds, consuming 0.02 kWh of electricity and 0.49392 Wh of gas, producing a CO2 equivalent emission of 0.0138019093344 kg alongside emissions of 0.49392 Wh from burning.

4. **Heating Process of Steel Sheet[1885]**: At 08:51:08 UTC, a heating operation was initiated for steel sheet o_steelsheet_1885 (weight: 0.02125 kg) at Workstation[1] with Machine[o_machine_oven01]. Similar to previous heating operations, it lasted 900 seconds, consumed 0.02 kWh of electricity and 0.49392 Wh of gas, resulting in a CO2 equivalent emission of 0.0138019093344 kg and burning emissions of 0.49392 Wh.

5. **Splitting Process of Steel Sheet[1894]**: Lastly, at 08:52:19 UTC, another splitting operation occurred using Machine[o_machine_splitter01] at the same workstation, splitting a steel sheet (ID: o_steelsheet_1894, weight: 0.02124 kg) from a coil with ID o_steelcoil_3. This process lasted approximately 14.14 seconds, consumed 0.0216034 kWh of electricity, produced 0.0147856674 kg of CO2, and generated 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

All these operations at Workstation[1] demonstrate a significant sequence of activities involving heating and splitting processes with measurable environmental impacts related to CO2 emissions and resource consumption.
