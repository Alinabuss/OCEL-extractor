**Report Summary for Object o_workstation_1**

On April 6, 2023, multiple operations were conducted at workstation Workstation[1] involving the splitting of steel sheets using the machine identified as Machine[Splitter01] (also referred to as "o_machine_splitter01"). 

1. **Event 1**: At 09:59:48 UTC, a steel coil identified as SteelCoil[1], weighing 31.91076 kg, was split, resulting in the production of SteelSheet[5133] with a mass of 0.02154 kg. This process took 14.0938456201 seconds, emitted 0.014737035 kg of CO2, consumed 0.0215323 kWh of electricity, and produced 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

2. **Event 2**: At 10:00:03 UTC, the same workstation split another portion of SteelCoil[1], producing SteelSheet[5134] weighing 0.02122 kg. This operation lasted approximately 15.02 seconds, generating 0.0157 kg of CO2 emissions and consuming 0.0229427 kWh of electricity, with 0.00042 kg of steel waste also produced.

3. **Event 3**: At 10:00:59 UTC, the process was repeated with SteelCoil[1], leading to the creation of SteelSheet[5138] with a mass of 0.02115 kg. The operation took approximately 14.57 seconds, emitting 0.0152393646 kg of CO2 and consuming 0.0222667 kWh of electricity, along with generating 0.00042 kg of steel waste.

4. **Event 4**: At 10:07:53 UTC, another steel sheet (ID: SteelSheet[5167], weighing 0.02116 kg) was produced from SteelCoil[1] in a duration of approximately 14.72 seconds. This operation emitted 0.01539 kg of CO2, utilized 0.02249 kWh of electricity, and produced 0.00042 kg of steel waste.

5. **Event 5**: Finally, at 10:10:30 UTC, a heating operation was performed by the machine "oven01" on a steel sheet identified as o_steelsheet_5174 at workstation o_workstation_1. This operation lasted 900 seconds, emitting 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalents, consuming 0.02 kWh of electricity, and utilizing 0.49392 Wh of gas.

Across these events, the steel coil SteelCoil[1] played a critical role in generating multiple steel sheets, with consistent energy consumption and steel waste production throughout the operations.
