**Summary Report for Object o_steelcoil_1**

On April 6, 2023, a series of splitting operations involving steel coil ID SteelCoil[1] were conducted at Workstation[1] using Machine[splitter01]. 

1. The first operation occurred at **08:28:44 UTC**, resulting in the creation of SteelSheet[4749]. This process lasted approximately **14.75 seconds**, generating **0.0154 kg** of CO2 equivalent emissions and consuming **0.0225 kWh** of electricity. Additionally, a small amount of **0.00042 kg** of steel waste was produced for recycling.

2. Shortly after, at **08:33:41 UTC**, another splitting operation took place, yielding SteelSheet[4770]. This operation spanned **14.89 seconds** and emitted **0.01557 kg** of CO2 equivalent. The energy consumed during this process was **0.02276 kWh**, and it produced **0.00042 kg** of steel waste. 

3. At **08:36:19 UTC**, Machine[splitter01] executed a third operation, producing SteelSheet[4781]. The splitting lasted approximately **14.32 seconds**, resulting in **0.01497 kg** of CO2 emissions, with an energy consumption of **0.02188 kWh**. Similar to the previous events, **0.00042 kg** of steel waste was generated.

4. Following this, at **08:37:30 UTC**, yet another operation on SteelCoil[1] produced SteelSheet[4786]. This lasted around **13.93 seconds**, resulting in **0.01456 kg** of CO2 emissions and consuming **0.021 kWh** of electricity while generating **0.00042 kg** of steel waste.

5. Lastly, at **09:18:35 UTC**, a further splitting operation by Machine[splitter01] created SteelSheet[4959]. This operation, known as the SplitSteelSheet process, lasted for approximately **14.63 seconds**, emitting **0.015298 kg** of CO2 and consuming **0.0223526 kWh** of electricity. It produced **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling as well. 

All operations were connected to the original steel coil ID SteelCoil[1], which has a total weight of **31.91076 kg** and was consistently associated with the produced steel sheets.
