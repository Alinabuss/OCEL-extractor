**Summary Report for Object o_workstation_1**

On April 5, 2023, several operations were conducted at Workstation[1] involving machine operations that produced various steel sheets:

1. At **12:03:33 UTC**, a **splitting process** was executed by **Machine[splitter01]** with steel coil ID **SteelCoil[2]**, weighing **31.91076 kg**. This operation generated the steel sheet **SteelSheet[4179]** (mass **0.02123 kg**). The splitting lasted **14.41 seconds**, producing **0.01507 kg** of CO2e, consuming **0.02201 kWh** of electricity, and generating **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling.

2. Shortly after, at **12:09:14 UTC**, the same machine, **Machine[Splitter01]**, utilized **SteelCoil[2]** again to create the steel sheet **SteelSheet[4203]** (mass **0.02103 kg**). This splitting process lasted **14.1422 seconds** and emitted **0.014788 kg** of CO2e, with an electricity consumption of **0.0216062 kWh** and was accompanied by **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling.

3. At **12:11:36 UTC**, a **heating process** was performed on steel sheet **SteelSheet[4209]** (mass **0.02129 kg**) using **Machine[oven01]**. This operation lasted for **900 seconds**, resulting in carbon emissions totaling **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2 equivalent, consuming **0.02 kWh** from the grid, and utilizing **0.49392 Wh** of gas input.

4. Subsequently, at **12:19:29 UTC**, the same heating machine, **oven01**, processed another steel sheet (ID **4242**, mass **0.02124 kg**) for **900 seconds**, generating **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2 emissions. The heating used **0.02 kWh** of electricity and **0.49392 Wh** of gas input.

5. Finally, at **12:25:24 UTC**, **o_machine_splitter01** operated at **o_workstation_1** to split the steel sheet, resulting in the production of a new steel sheet identified as **o_steelsheet_4271** from a steel coil labeled **o_steelcoil_2**, weighing **31.91076 kg**. This splitting lasted for **14.54 seconds**, outputting steel with a mass of **0.02106 kg** and generating approximately **0.0152 kg** of CO2. The process consumed about **0.0222 kWh** of electricity and produced **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling.

Throughout these operations, Workstation[1] effectively carried out various processing tasks, utilizing specific machines to manipulate the steel coils and sheets, while accounting for emissions and resource consumption.
