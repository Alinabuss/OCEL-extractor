On April 6, 2023, several operations occurred, all contributing to the day's production activities. 

At 11:39:33 UTC, a coating operation took place involving a formed part with ID o_formedpart_5481 at workstation o_workstation_1. This operation utilized machine o_machine_coater03 and lasted for 300 seconds, consuming 0.25 kWh of electric energy from the grid. The process produced 0.1751156951 kg of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, used 0.0004 kg of coating material, and resulted in 0.0001 kg of waste.

Shortly thereafter, at 11:41:34 UTC, another formed part with ID o_formedpart_5486 was coated using the same machine, o_machine_coater03, also at workstation o_workstation_1. This procedure matched the previous in duration, lasting 300 seconds with identical energy consumption and emissions. The operation similarly generated 0.1751156951 kg of CO2 equivalent while utilizing 0.0004 kg of coating material and producing 0.0001 kg of waste.

Following this, at 11:43:02 UTC, a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[5497], weighing 0.02106 kg, was processed into a formed part called FormedPart[5497] at workstation[1]. The processing utilized machine Machine[former02] for 5.0 seconds, generating 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 equivalent and consuming 0.0041667 kWh of electrical energy from the grid.

Just moments later, at 11:43:20 UTC, another steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_5496, weighing 0.02121 kg, was transformed into FormedPart with ID o_formedpart_5496, again using machine o_machine_former02 at workstation o_workstation_1. This operation also lasted 5.0 seconds, mirroring the previous emissions of 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 equivalent and the energy consumption of 0.0041667 kWh.

Finally, at 11:43:48 UTC, a cutting process occurred at workstation[2] using machine Machine[cutter01]. During this operation, a formed part with ID FormedPart[5131] was inputted, resulting in a male part with ID MalePart[5131] as output. The activity lasted approximately 10.017 seconds, emitting 0.064384 kg of CO2 equivalent and consuming 0.0153044 kWh of electricity from the grid. Additionally, this process utilized 0.051 m³ of compressed air and 0.061 m³ of nitrogen gas, with the latter also being the same volume emitted into the air. Details concerning any potential steel waste generated in this operation remain unspecified. 

Overall, the day's operations at various workstations effectively transformed raw materials, involving multiple machines, into finished parts while tracking emissions and resource consumption effectively.
