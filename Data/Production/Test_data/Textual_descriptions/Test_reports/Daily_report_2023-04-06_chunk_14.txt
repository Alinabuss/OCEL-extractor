On April 6, 2023, several significant events took place regarding the coating and forming of parts at Workstation[1] with the involvement of Machine[coater03] and Machine[former02].

The first event occurred at 12:00:51 UTC, where a formed part identified as o_formedpart_5568 underwent a coating process. This operation lasted for 300 seconds, during which it consumed 0.25 kWh of electricity and emitted 0.1751156951 kg of CO2 equivalents. A total of 0.0004 kg of coating material was utilized, resulting in 0.0001 kg of waste generated from the coating material.

Just a few seconds later, at 12:03:48 UTC, a part recognized as FormedPart[5583] was also coated using the same machine, Machine[coater03], located at Workstation[1]. This process again lasted for 300 seconds and produced the same emissions and waste metrics: 0.1751156951 kg of CO2 emissions, 0.25 kWh of electricity consumed, and 0.0004 kg of coating material utilized, leading to 0.0001 kg of waste.

At 12:03:55 UTC, another coating process took place involving a formed part with ID o_formedpart_5581, which also occurred at Workstation[1] with Machine[coater03]. This operation mirrored the earlier coating events, lasting 300 seconds and generating the same quantities of CO2 emissions, electric consumption, and waste.

Subsequently, at 12:04:06 UTC, a process involving Machine[former02] commenced at Workstation[1] to form a steel sheet. The input for this operation was SteelSheet[5585], weighing 0.02125 kg, and it resulted in the creation of a new formed part denoted as FormedPart[5585]. The entire forming process was quick, taking just 5 seconds, with emissions of approximately 0.00285 kg of CO2 equivalents and electricity consumption of around 0.0041667 kWh.

Finally, at 12:06:02 UTC, yet another coating operation was conducted on a formed part identified as o_formedpart_5592 using Machine[coater03] at Workstation[1]. Like the previous coating events, this process also took 300 seconds, yielding 0.1751156951 kg of CO2 emissions, consuming 0.25 kWh of electricity, and utilizing 0.0004 kg of coating material, which produced 0.0001 kg of waste.

Each of these events demonstrates the relationships between the machines, workstations, and the parts being processed on April 6, 2023.
