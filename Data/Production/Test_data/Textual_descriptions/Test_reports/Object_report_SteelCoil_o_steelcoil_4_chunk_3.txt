**Report on Object o_steelcoil_4**

On April 3, 2023, multiple operations involving the steel coil identified as SteelCoil[4], which has a mass of 31.91076 kg, were carried out at Workstation[1] using the machine named Machine[splitter01].

1. **First Operation**: At 09:28:59 UTC, a steel sheet was split, resulting in SteelSheet[568]. This operation lasted approximately 13.97 seconds, during which it emitted 0.0146 kg of CO2 equivalent, produced 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling, and consumed 0.0213505 kWh of electricity.

2. **Second Operation**: At 09:39:55 UTC, another steel sheet was split. This process took about 13.92 seconds, producing 0.01456 kg of CO2 emissions and generating 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling. The electric consumption during this operation was recorded as 0.02127 kWh, and the resulting steel sheet weighed 0.02109 kg.

3. **Third Operation**: At 09:54:24 UTC, Machine[splitter01] split a steel sheet, resulting in SteelSheet[675]. This process lasted approximately 14.32 seconds, producing 0.01498 kg of CO2 and generating 0.00042 kg of steel waste meant for recycling. The energy consumption during this operation was 0.02188 kWh.

4. **Fourth Operation**: At 09:55:48 UTC, the machine split another steel sheet, resulting in SteelSheet[681], which weighed 0.02125 kg. This operation lasted 13.99 seconds, during which it emitted 0.014629 kg of CO2, consumed 0.0213748 kWh of electricity, and produced 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

5. **Fifth Operation**: Finally, at 09:57:00 UTC, Machine[splitter01] conducted another split, resulting in SteelSheet[686], weighing 0.02128 kg. This operation took approximately 14.36 seconds, emitted 0.015 kg of CO2, generated 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling, and consumed around 0.02194 kWh of electricity.

Throughout these operations at Workstation[1], all resulting steel sheets were consistently created from SteelCoil[4].
