On April 4, 2023, a series of cutting operations were performed at specified workstations, involving various parts and machines. 

At 14:21:06 UTC, a cutting operation was executed on a male part identified as MalePart[2485]. This operation was conducted using Machine[1] located at Workstation[2]. The cutting process took approximately 10 seconds and produced a formed part. During this operation, 0.068 kg of CO2 emissions were generated alongside the consumption of 0.0153 kWh of electricity, 0.061 m³ of compressed air, and 0.061 m³ of nitrogen gas, which was also emitted into the air.

Shortly thereafter, at 14:22:14 UTC, another cutting operation was performed using a formed part with the ID o_formedpart_2477 as input. This operation was carried out with the machine labeled as o_machine_cutter01 at workstation o_workstation_2. The output was a male part known as o_malepart_2477. The cutting process lasted about 10.14 seconds, resulting in CO2 equivalent emissions of 0.07177 kg, and consuming 0.01549 kWh of electricity, 0.066 m³ of compressed air, and 0.062 m³ of nitrogen gas, which was also emitted into the air. The details regarding steel waste generated during this operation remain unspecified.

Later on the same day, at 14:36:07 UTC, another cutting operation was performed using Machine[o_machine_cutter01] at Workstation[o_workstation_2]. This process produced a male part identified as MalePart[o_malepart_2686], utilizing an input formed part designated as FormedPart[o_formedpart_2686]. The cutting process lasted approximately 10.01 seconds, resulting in CO2 emissions of 0.07296 kg, and consumed 0.0153 kWh of electricity, 0.08 m³ of compressed air, and 0.061 m³ of nitrogen gas, which was also emitted as waste. The mass of the produced male part remained unspecified.

In summary, all operations on April 4, 2023, involved various machines and resulted in the production of male parts from formed parts, with detailed accounts of the emissions and resources utilized during each cutting process.
