**Report on Heating Operations of Steel Sheets at o_machine_oven01**

On April 6, 2023, several heating operations were performed on steel sheets using the machine identified as o_machine_oven01, located at workstation o_workstation_1.

1. **Event 1**: At **11:44:27 UTC**, a steel sheet with ID **o_steelsheet_5570** (mass: 0.02107 kg) underwent heating for **900 seconds**. This process generated **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2 equivalent emissions. Energy consumption was recorded at **0.02 kWh** from the grid, with **0.49392 Wh** of gas input and equivalent emissions also at **0.49392 Wh**.

2. **Event 2**: At **11:51:21 UTC**, another heating operation was performed on a steel sheet identified as **SteelSheet[5599]** (mass: 0.02104 kg) for the same duration of **900 seconds**. This operation yielded **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2 equivalent emissions. Energy from the grid consumed was **0.02 kWh**, and gas input was **0.49392 Wh**, matching the emissions from the burning process.

3. **Event 3**: At **11:57:07 UTC**, a heating process took place for a steel sheet with ID **steelsheet_5623** (mass: 0.02105 kg), lasting **900 seconds**. The operation resulted in **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2 equivalent emissions, with energy consumption of **0.02 kWh** from the grid and a gas input of **0.49392 Wh**, alongside equivalent emissions recorded from the burning process.

4. **Event 4**: At **12:12:51 UTC**, the machine processed a steel sheet labeled **SteelSheet[5690]** (mass: 0.02126 kg) through a **900 seconds** heating operation, producing approximately **0.0138 kg** of CO2 equivalent emissions. The operation drew **0.02 kWh** of electricity from the grid and utilized **0.49392 Wh** of gas, which corresponded to the emissions from the burn.

5. **Event 5**: Finally, at **12:15:00 UTC**, a steel sheet with ID **o_steelsheet_5699** (mass: 0.02107 kg) underwent heating at workstation o_workstation_1 for **900 seconds**. This process again emitted around **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2 equivalent. Energy consumption was consistent at **0.02 kWh** from the grid, with **0.49392 Wh** of gas input and equivalent emissions from the burn.

In summary, throughout the day, the machine o_machine_oven01 processed multiple steel sheets under similar operational conditions, consistently resulting in comparable energy consumption and CO2 equivalent emissions.
