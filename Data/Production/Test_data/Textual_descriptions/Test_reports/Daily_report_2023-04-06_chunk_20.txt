On April 6, 2023, a series of operations involving cutting male and female parts took place at Workstation o_workstation_2. 

The first event occurred at 14:10:26 UTC when the machine with ID o_machine_cutter01 was utilized to cut a male part, identified as o_malepart_5820. This operation, known as CuttMalePart, lasted for approximately 10.04 seconds and consumed various resources: 0.0153337 kWh of electricity, 0.066 cubic meters of compressed air, and 0.061 cubic meters of nitrogen gas. During this process, emissions included 0.061 cubic meters of air and approximately 0.0703 kg of carbon dioxide equivalent.

Shortly thereafter, at 14:13:03 UTC, the machine identified as Machine[manual cutter01], also located at Workstation[2], was engaged in cutting another male part, resulting in MalePart[5775]. This operation lasted around 9.998 seconds, consuming 0.015 kWh of grid electricity, 0.077 cubic meters of compressed air, and 0.061 cubic meters of nitrogen gas. It emitted 0.075 kg of CO2 into the atmosphere and transformed the formed part labeled FormedPart[5775] into the aforementioned male part.

At 14:15:40 UTC, a further cutting operation occurred utilizing the machine with ID machine_cutter01. This process involved the formed part with ID formedpart_5621 and produced the male part with ID malepart_5621. The cutting lasted approximately 10.12 seconds, with resource usage including 0.01546 kWh of electricity, 0.073 cubic meters of compressed air, and 0.062 cubic meters of nitrogen gas. The operation resulted in an emission of 0.07279 kg of CO2, alongside unspecified steel waste.

Subsequently, at 14:20:33 UTC, machine named cutter01 continued operations by cutting yet another male part, resulting in malepart_5596 from the formed part with ID formedpart_5596. This process lasted about 10.08 seconds, consuming 0.0154 kWh of electricity, 0.08 cubic meters of compressed air, and 0.062 cubic meters of nitrogen gas, while emitting 0.0759 kg of CO2 equivalent. The mass of steel waste produced in this operation is also unspecified. 

Finally, at 14:24:29 UTC, the same machine, identified as Machine[cutter01], was used to cut a female part identified as FemalePart[5694]. This operation lasted approximately 12.49 seconds and resulted in the formation of a corresponding formed part, FormedPart[5694]. Throughout this process, the machine consumed 0.019 kWh of electricity and utilized 0.071 cubic meters of compressed air along with 0.076 cubic meters of nitrogen gas, generating 0.083 kg of CO2 equivalent and producing 0.00254 kg of steel waste. During the operation, nitrogen gas emissions totaled 0.076 cubic meters.

In summary, all these activities on April 6, 2023, illustrate a concentrated effort at Workstation o_workstation_2, leading to the successful production of both male and female parts from various formed parts.
