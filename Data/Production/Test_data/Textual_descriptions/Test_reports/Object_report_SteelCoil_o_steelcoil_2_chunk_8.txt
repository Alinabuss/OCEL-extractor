**Report for Object o_steelcoil_2**

On April 5, 2023, multiple events involving the object o_steelcoil_2 were recorded.

1. At **12:25:24 UTC**, a process was conducted using the machine identified as **o_machine_splitter01** at the workstation **o_workstation_1**. This operation lasted approximately **14.54 seconds** and resulted in the creation of a new steel sheet, designated as **o_steelsheet_4271**. The process split the steel coil, which weighs about **31.91076 kg**, producing a steel sheet with a mass of **0.02106 kg**. The activity emitted around **0.0152 kg** of CO2 equivalent, consumed **0.0222 kWh** of electricity from the grid, and generated a minimal steel waste weighing approximately **0.00042 kg** for recycling.

2. At **12:40:54 UTC**, another splitting operation was conducted on the same machine, **o_machine_splitter01**, at the same workstation, **o_workstation_1**. This operation lasted for about **13.67 seconds** and produced a steel sheet identified as **o_steelsheet_4336**. The steel coil used, **SteelCoil[o_steelcoil_2]**, similarly weighed **31.91076 kg**. During this event, **0.0143 kg** of CO2 equivalent was emitted, **0.0209 kWh** of electricity was consumed, and **0.00042 kg** of steel waste was generated for recycling.

3. Finally, at **12:59:54 UTC**, the same machine, referred here also as **Machine[splitter01]**, and the workstation **Workstation[1]** were involved in another splitting event utilizing **SteelCoil[2]** (o_steelcoil_2). This process took **14.01 seconds** and produced a steel sheet identified as **SteelSheet[4416]** weighing **0.02132 kg**. The activity resulted in a CO2 equivalent emission of **0.01465 kg**, consumed **0.02141 kWh** of electricity, and generated **0.00042 kg** of recyclable steel waste.

Across all recorded events, the steel coil o_steelcoil_2 was consistently involved, highlighting its role in the steel sheet production processes conducted at workstation o_workstation_1 using the machine o_machine_splitter01.
