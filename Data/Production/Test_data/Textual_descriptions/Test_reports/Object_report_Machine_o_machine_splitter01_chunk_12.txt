**Event Report for Object: o_machine_splitter01**

On April 4, 2023, the machine identified as Splitter01, located at Workstation[1], executed a series of steel sheet splitting operations. 

1. The first operation commenced at **08:16:01 UTC**, lasting approximately **13.9999 seconds**. In this process, a steel sheet was produced from SteelCoil[3], which had an initial mass of **31.91076 kg**. The resulting steel sheet weighed **0.02128 kg**, and the operation generated **0.0146 kg** of CO2 emissions, consumed **0.0213888 kWh** from the grid, and produced **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling.

2. Shortly thereafter, at **08:18:25 UTC**, another splitting operation occurred, which lasted approximately **13.93 seconds**. This operation again utilized SteelCoil[3] and resulted in the production of SteelSheet[1751], weighing **0.02134 kg**. This task generated approximately **0.01456 kg** of CO2 equivalent and required **0.0212765 kWh** of electricity. An additional **0.00042 kg** of steel waste was also produced for recycling.

3. At **08:23:53 UTC**, another task was performed on the same machine, lasting approximately **15.15 seconds**. This operation yielded SteelSheet[1774], with a mass of **0.02126 kg**, once more utilizing SteelCoil[3]. The machine emitted **0.01584 kg** of CO2 emissions and consumed **0.0231412 kWh** of electricity, while **0.00042 kg** of steel waste was also generated.

4. Continuing, at **08:24:23 UTC**, Splitter01 executed another operation, taking approximately **13.86 seconds**. This led to the creation of SteelSheet[1776], weighing **0.02104 kg**, with the same initial SteelCoil[3]. The operation generated **0.0144958566 kg** of CO2 emissions, utilized **0.0211797 kWh** of electricity, and produced **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling.

5. Finally, at **08:30:18 UTC**, the machine conducted another splitting operation, lasting **15.31 seconds**. This resulted in the output of SteelSheet[1801] weighing **0.02119 kg**, sourced again from SteelCoil[3]. During this process, **0.0160 kg** of CO2 equivalent was generated, consuming **0.0234 kWh** of electricity, with **0.00042 kg** of steel waste earmarked for recycling.

Throughout these operations, the initial mass of SteelCoil[3] consistently remained at **31.91076 kg**.
