On April 3, 2023, several significant operations took place across different workstations, all contributing to the production process.

At 09:02:31 UTC, a machine identified as Machine with ID o_machine_former02, located at Workstation with ID o_workstation_1, processed a SteelSheet (ID: o_steelsheet_385) weighing 0.02127 kg. This operation, named FormSteelSheet, utilized 0.0041667 kWh of electric power and lasted for 5 seconds. The process generated a formed part, identified as o_formedpart_385, although the mass of this part is unspecified. Additionally, it emitted 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 equivalent during this operation.

Shortly thereafter, at 09:05:24 UTC, the formed part (ID: FormedPart[2]) was processed to create a male part (ID: MalePart[2]) using a machine referred to as Cutter[1] at Workstation[2]. This cutting operation lasted approximately 10.08 seconds, utilized around 0.0154 kWh of electricity, and resulted in emissions of 0.0739 kg of CO2, alongside the consumption of 0.072 m続 of compressed air and 0.062 m続 of nitrogen gas.

Next, at 09:13:03 UTC, a female part, identified as FemalePart[o_femalepart_1], was produced from a formed part (ID: o_formedpart_1) using a machine with ID Machine[o_machine_cutter01] at Workstation[o_workstation_2]. This cutting process took approximately 12.49 seconds, consuming 0.019 kWh of electricity and 0.081 m続 of compressed air, while emitting 0.085 kg of CO2 equivalent. The operation also emitted 0.076 m続 of nitrogen gas into the air and pro
