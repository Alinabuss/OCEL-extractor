**Report for Object: o_steelcoil_3**

On April 4, 2023, the object o_steelcoil_3, weighing 31.91076 kg, was utilized in several splitting operations at Workstation o_workstation_1 using the machine identified as o_machine_splitter01.

- At **12:23:23 UTC**, the first operation involved the creation of a steel sheet from the coil. This process took approximately 14.34 seconds, resulting in the creation of a steel sheet weighing 0.02114 kg. The operation emitted 0.015 kg of CO2 equivalents, consumed 0.021915 kWh of electricity, and produced a negligible amount of steel waste (0.00042 kg) for recycling.

- Shortly after, at **12:24:05 UTC**, another steel sheet, identified as o_steelsheet_2786 and weighing 0.02124 kg, was produced through a similar splitting process. This operation lasted for 13.95 seconds, generating 0.014587239 kg of CO2 equivalents and consuming 0.0213133 kWh of electricity, with also 0.00042 kg of steel waste generated.

- At **12:26:15 UTC**, the third operation utilized the same steel coil, resulting in the creation of another steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[2795], which had a mass of 0.02086 kg. This operation took approximately 14.73 seconds, emitted 0.0154 kg of CO2 equivalents, and consumed 0.0225 kWh of electricity. The minimal steel waste produced for recycling was again recorded at 0.00042 kg.

- Finally, at **13:01:47 UTC**, a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_2944 was produced from o_steelcoil_3 in an operation that lasted approximately 13.75 seconds. This resulted in CO2 emissions of 0.014378277 kg, with electricity consumption of 0.0210078 kWh, and again, minimal steel waste of 0.00042 kg.

Throughout these operations, the consistent mass of the steel coil and the minimal waste produced illustrate efficient utilization of the material across all described events.
