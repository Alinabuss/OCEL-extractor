On April 4, 2023, at 09:26:56 UTC, the workstation with ID Workstation[1], located at Machine[Splitter01], initiated the splitting process for the steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[2040]. This operation lasted approximately 13.61 seconds and resulted in a new steel sheet weighing 0.02124 kg. The process utilized SteelCoil[3], which has a total mass of 31.91076 kg. During the splitting, an energy consumption of 0.0207966 kWh was recorded, leading to carbon dioxide equivalent emissions of 0.0142338162 kg. Additionally, the process generated a negligible amount of steel waste, measuring 0.00042 kg, intended for recycling. The steel sheet produced, SteelSheet[2040], is directly linked as the output of this operation.
