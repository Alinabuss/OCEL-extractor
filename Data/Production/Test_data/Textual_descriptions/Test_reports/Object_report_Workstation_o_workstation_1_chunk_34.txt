**Summary Report for Object o_workstation_1**

On April 4, 2023, at 13:01:47 UTC, the splitting process at workstation ID "o_workstation_1" used machine "o_machine_splitter01" to produce a steel sheet with ID "o_steelsheet_2944" from steel coil "o_steelcoil_3". This operation lasted approximately 13.75 seconds, resulting in emissions of 0.014378277 kg of CO2 and consuming 0.0210078 kWh of electricity. The initial mass of the steel coil was 31.91076 kg, and the resulting steel sheet weighed 0.02097 kg, with a minimal steel waste of 0.00042 kg set for recycling.

The following day, on April 5, 2023, multiple operations occurred involving workstation "Workstation[1]" and machine "Machine[splitter01]". At 07:38:47 UTC, the machine split a steel sheet with ID "SteelSheet[2961]" from steel coil "SteelCoil[2]". This operation lasted 6.60456992673 seconds, producing a steel sheet weighing 0.02111 kg, with emissions of 0.006910707 kg of CO2, 0.00042 kg of steel waste, and an electrical consumption of 0.0100903 kWh.

Shortly after, at 07:39:00 UTC, the same machine again at "o_workstation_1" initiated another splitting operation, utilizing steel coil "o_steelcoil_2" to create steel sheet "o_steelsheet_2963". This process lasted approximately 6.43 seconds, emitting 0.00673 kg of CO2, generating 0.00042 kg of recyclable steel waste, and consuming about 0.00982 kWh of electrical energy. The steel coil used had a mass of 31.91076 kg, while the resulting steel sheet weighed 0.02103 kg.

Later that day at 07:40:42 UTC, another operation took place at workstation "Workstation[1]", where machine "Machine[oven01]" processed steel sheet "SteelSheet[2969]" in a heating operation lasting 900 seconds. This operation consumed 0.02 kWh of electricity and resulted in CO2 emissions of approximately 0.0138019093344 kg.

Finally, at 07:44:33 UTC, the splitting process resumed at Workstation 1, with machine "Splitter01" producing steel sheet "SteelSheet[3013]" from steel coil "SteelCoil[2]". This operation lasted about 6.48 seconds, with emissions of 0.0068 kg of CO2 and electricity consumption of approximately 0.0099 kWh. The initial mass of the steel coil was 31.91 kg, and the newly produced steel sheet weighed 0.02122 kg, with 0.00042 kg of steel waste intended for recycling.
