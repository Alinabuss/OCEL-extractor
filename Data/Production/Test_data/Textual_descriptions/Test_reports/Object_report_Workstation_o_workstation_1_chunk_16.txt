**Date: April 3, 2023**

1. **Event at 12:55:45 UTC**: A machine identified as **Splitter01**, located at **o_workstation_1**, performed a splitting operation on a steel sheet. This task took approximately **14.25 seconds**, resulting in **0.014905 kg** of CO2 emissions. The operation consumed **0.0217778 kWh** of electricity from the grid and generated **0.00042 kg** of steel waste intended for recycling. The steel sheet involved had the ID **SteelSheet[1438]**, created from a steel coil identified as **SteelCoil[4]**, which had a mass of **31.91076 kg**.

2. **Event at 13:00:32 UTC**: Another splitting operation was conducted on the same workstation using the machine **Machine[splitter01]** and the steel coil **SteelCoil[4]**. This operation resulted in the creation of a new steel sheet with ID **SteelSheet[1458]**, lasting approximately **13.73 seconds** and producing **0.02099 kg** of the steel sheet along with **0.01436 kg** of CO2 emissions. The operation also generated **0.00042 kg** of steel waste designated for recycling. The involved steel coil had the same mass of **31.91076 kg**.

3. **Event at 13:03:36 UTC**: The machine **splitter01** processed a different steel coil identified as **o_steelcoil_4** (mass: **31.91076 kg**) to create a steel sheet identified as **o_steelsheet_1471** with a weight of **0.02103 kg**. This event lasted approximately **14.593 seconds** and resulted in **0.0152590638 kg** of CO2 emissions and **0.00042 kg** of steel waste earmarked for recycling. The workstation also recorded its electrical consumption during this operation.

4. **Event at 13:05:01 UTC**: The machine **Machine[splitter01]** operated in **Workstation[1]**, utilizing the same steel coil **SteelCoil[4]** to create another steel sheet, identified as **SteelSheet[1477]**. The process lasted approximately **14.41 seconds** and produced **0.00042 kg** of steel waste intended for recycling, along with **0.01506 kg** of CO2 emissions. It consumed **0.02201 kWh** of electricity from the grid during this operation.

**Date: April 4, 2023**

5. **Event at 07:44:00 UTC**: A new splitting operation occurred at **o_workstation_1**, utilizing the machine labeled **o_machine_splitter01** and the steel coil **o_steelcoil_3**. This operation created a new steel sheet labeled **o_steelsheet_1529**, weighing **0.02111 kg**. The process took **6.76390904493 seconds**, producing **0.0070771926 kg** of CO2 emissions and consuming **0.0103337 kWh** of electricity from the grid, along with generating **0.00042 kg** of steel waste set for recycling.
