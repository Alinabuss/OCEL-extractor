On April 3, 2023, a series of operations were conducted, each involving different components and machinery at specific timestamps.

At 09:30:17 UTC, a cutting operation took place at Workstation[2] using Machine[1]. This operation involved a formed part identified as FormedPart[22], resulting in a female part labeled FemalePart[22]. The process lasted approximately 12.45 seconds, consuming around 0.019 kWh of electricity and emitting 0.0839 kg of CO2. Minor emissions included 0.078 m³ of compressed air and 0.076 m³ of nitrogen gas, along with 0.00253 kg of waste steel produced during the operation.

Shortly after, at 09:30:30 UTC, a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_504, weighing 0.02098 kg, was utilized as an input for forming a part at Workstation o_workstation_1, which utilized Machine o_machine_former02. This forming operation took 5.0 seconds, resulting in the creation of formed part o_formedpart_504. The process consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electricity and emitted approximately 0.0028500228 kg of CO2.

Then at 09:37:35 UTC, a coating operation commenced for the formed part identified as o_formedpart_529 at Workstation o_workstation_1. This process lasted for 300 seconds, consumed 0.25 kWh of electricity, and resulted in emissions of 0.1751156951 kg of CO2. During this operation, 0.0004 kg of coating material was utilized, leading to the generation of 0.0001 kg of coating material waste, all performed with Machine o_machine_coater03.

Following this, another coating process occurred at 09:39:01 UTC for a part identified as FormedPart[534] at Workstation[1] using Machine[coater03]. This procedure also took 300 seconds, emitted approximately 0.175 kg of CO2 equivalent, and consumed 0.25 kWh of electricity, utilizing 0.0004 kg of coating material and creating 0.0001 kg of coating waste.

Lastly, at 09:42:14 UTC, a forming operation was executed at Workstation o_workstation_1, processing a steel sheet identified as o_steelsheet_554 with a mass of 0.02117 kg. This operation, carried out using Machine o_machine_former02, lasted for 5.0 seconds and produced a formed part labeled o_formedpart_554. The process consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electricity and emitted approximately 0.0028500228 kg of CO2.

Overall, these activities represent a dynamic workflow involving various machine operations, part transformations, and emissions on April 3, 2023.
