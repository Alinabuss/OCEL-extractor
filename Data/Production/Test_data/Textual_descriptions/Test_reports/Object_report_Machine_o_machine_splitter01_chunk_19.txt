**Report for Object o_machine_splitter01**

On April 4, 2023, the machine identified as o_machine_splitter01, located at Workstation o_workstation_1, performed multiple operations involving steel coils and steel sheets, detailed as follows:

1. **First Operation**: At 12:10:59 UTC, o_machine_splitter01 was used to split a steel coil (ID: SteelCoil[3], mass: 31.91076 kg), which created a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[2731] weighing 0.02107 kg. This operation lasted approximately 14.59978 seconds, emitted 0.0152656986 kg of CO2 equivalent, consumed 0.0223052 kWh of electricity, and produced 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

2. **Second Operation**: At 12:14:18 UTC, another steel sheet (ID: SteelSheet[2745]) was produced from the same steel coil. This process lasted about 14.085 seconds and resulted in an emission of 0.01473 kg of CO2. The operation consumed 0.02152 kWh of electricity and generated 0.00042 kg of steel waste.

3. **Third Operation**: The next operation occurred at 12:17:37 UTC, resulting in a steel sheet weighing 0.02112 kg, again created from the steel coil with a mass of 31.91076 kg. This splitting took approximately 14.13 seconds, producing 0.014776 kg of CO2 emissions and consuming 0.0215894 kWh of electricity. The operation also yielded 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

4. **Fourth Operation**: At 12:23:23 UTC, another steel sheet was processed, resulting in a sheet that weighed 0.02114 kg. This operation took about 14.34 seconds, emitted 0.015 kg of CO2, and used 0.021915 kWh of electricity, alongside the generation of 0.00042 kg of steel waste.

5. **Fifth Operation**: The final operation took place at 12:24:05 UTC, where the steel coil (ID: o_steelcoil_3) was used to create a steel sheet identified as o_steelsheet_2786, weighing 0.02124 kg. This process lasted 13.95054 seconds, and emitted 0.014587239 kg of CO2 equivalents. It consumed 0.0213133 kWh of electricity and produced 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

Throughout these events, the relationship between the steel coils and steel sheets was consistently demonstrated, highlighting the manufacturing process's efficiency and effectiveness in recycling steel waste.
