On April 5, 2023, a series of events took place involving different machines and parts at Workstation with ID workstation_2.

At 14:29:34 UTC, Machine with ID machine_cutter01 utilized the input FormedPart with ID formedpart_4361 to cut a MalePart with ID malepart_4361. This operation lasted approximately 9.99 seconds and resulted in an emission of 0.0673 kg of CO2 equivalent. During this cutting process, the machine consumed 0.0153 kWh of electricity, 0.059 m³ of compressed air, and involved 0.061 m³ of nitrogen gas, which was also emitted into the atmosphere. Notably, there was no measurable steel waste generated from this operation.

Shortly after, at 14:31:59 UTC, a female part with ID FemalePart[4296] was cut using the same machine, Machine[cutter01], located at Workstation[2]. This operation lasted approximately 12.4 seconds and produced an output female part with ID FemalePart[4296]. This process consumed 0.0189 kWh of electricity, utilized 0.084 m³ of compressed air, and involved 0.076 m³ of nitrogen gas, which was also emitted. Furthermore, this operation resulted in a waste of 0.00251 kg of steel and generated a carbon dioxide equivalent emission of 0.0883 kg. The formed part with ID FormedPart[4296] was created from the female part employed in this operation.

Finally, at 14:35:34 UTC, the machine identified as Cutter01 cut another male part, resulting in an output male part with ID 4377. This process took approximately 10.03 seconds and was also performed at Workstation 2. The operation consumed 0.0153166 kWh of electricity, 0.063 m³ of compressed air, and involved 0.061 m³ of nitrogen gas, which was emitted in equal volume. Additionally, this process generated a CO2 equivalent emission of 0.0686816432889 kg. The input for this operation was a formed part with ID 4377, which was created from a male part.

These events illustrate the detailed interactions and relationships among the machines, parts, and resources utilized throughout the day at Workstation 2 on April 5, 2023.
