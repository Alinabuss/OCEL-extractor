   - **Steel Waste**: 0.00042 kg (designated for recycling)  
   - **Output**: Resulted in the creation of the steel sheet from the original steel coil.  

2. **Second Operation**  
   - **Timestamp**: April 6, 2023, at 11:40:57 UTC  
   - **Process**: Another split operation on the steel sheet resulted in the creation of a new sheet weighing 0.02108 kg.  
   - **Duration**: Approximately 13.99 seconds  
   - **Energy Consumption**: 0.0213713 kWh  
   - **CO2 Emissions**: 0.014626911 kg  
   - **Steel Waste**: 0.00042 kg (sent for recycling)  
   - **Output**: This operation also stemmed from the same steel coil weighing 31.91076 kg.  

3. **Third Operation**  
   - **Timestamp**: April 6, 2023, at 11:57:32 UTC  
   - **Process**: A split was performed on the steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[5629], weighing 0.02147 kg.  
   - **Duration**: Approximately 13.84 seconds  
   - **Energy Consumption**: 0.0211447 kWh  
   - **CO2 Emissions**: 0.0144719166 kg  
   - **Steel Waste**: 0.00042 kg (generated for recycling)  
   - **Output**: This operation involved creating the steel sheet from SteelCoil[1], which is the same steel coil weighing 31.91076 kg.  

4. **Fourth Operation**  
   - **Timestamp**: April 6, 2023, at 12:11:29 UTC  
   - **Process**: Another split of a steel sheet took place, resulting in a new steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_5688, weighing 0.02106 kg.  
   - **Duration**: Approximately 13.88 seconds  
   - **Energy Consumption**: Not explicitly stated, but linked to energy metrics at the workstation.  
   - **CO2 Emissions**: 0.0145 kg  
   - **Steel Waste**: 0.00042 kg (designated for recycling)  
   - **Output**: The steel sheet was created from the same Steel Coil with ID o_steelcoil_1.  

5. **Fifth Operation**  
   - **Timestamp**: April 6, 2023, at 12:16:53 UTC  
   - **Process**: The machine processed another steel sheet resulting in o_steelsheet_5711, weighing 0.02125 kg.  
   - **Duration**: Approximately 13.785 seconds  
   - **Energy Consumption**: 0.0210607 kWh  
   - **CO2 Emissions**: 0.014414 kg  
   - **Steel Waste**: 0.00042 kg (for recycling)  
   - **Output**: The operation yielded the new steel sheet from the same steel coil ID steelcoil_1.  

Throughout these operations, the consistent utilization of the steel coil o_steelcoil_1 and the machine o_machine_splitter01 at workstation o_workstation_1 indicates a streamlined process focused on producing various steel sheets with minimal environmental impact, evidenced by consistent recycling of steel waste and monitored electricity consumption.
