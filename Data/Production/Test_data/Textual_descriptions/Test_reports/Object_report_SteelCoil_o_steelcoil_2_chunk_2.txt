On April 5, 2023, the object o_steelcoil_2, with a mass of 31.91076 kg, underwent multiple splitting processes throughout the day, all executed at Workstation[1] using the machine known as Machine[splitter01].

1. The first event occurred at 08:23:01 UTC, where a steel sheet labeled SteelSheet[3250] with a mass of 0.02122 kg was produced. This operation lasted approximately 13.86 seconds and generated 0.01449 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions while consuming 0.0211719 kWh of electricity and creating 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

2. Shortly after, at 08:32:05 UTC, another splitting took place, resulting in the creation of a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[3288]. This process lasted about 13.793 seconds. It emitted 0.014422737 kg of CO2 and utilized 0.0210728 kWh of electricity, with 0.00042 kg of steel waste also produced.

3. At 08:33:02 UTC, the same machine processed the steel coil to produce a steel sheet, SteelSheet[3292]. This operation lasted approximately 14.90 seconds, resulting in emissions of around 0.016 kg of CO2 and consuming 0.0228 kWh of electricity, along with 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling. The newly created steel sheet weighed 0.0213 kg.

4. Another transformation occurred at 08:33:31 UTC, under the process "SplitSteelSheet," producing a steel sheet (ID: o_steelsheet_3294) with a mass of 0.02125 kg. The operation lasted about 14.16 seconds, emitting 0.01481 kg of CO2 equivalent, consuming 0.02163 kWh of electricity, and generating 0.00042 kg of steel waste.

5. Finally, at 08:44:41 UTC, another steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[3341] was produced with a mass of 0.02101 kg. This process lasted approximately 14.051 seconds and emitted 0.0146923698 kg of CO2 equivalent while consuming 0.021467 kWh of electricity and creating 0.00042 kg of steel waste.

Throughout the day, the object o_steelcoil_2 was consistently transformed into various steel sheets, indicating a clear relationship between the steel coil, the machine, and the workstation involved in these processes.
