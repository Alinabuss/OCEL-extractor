**Report for Object o_machine_oven01**

On April 3, 2023, the heating process for steel sheets was conducted using machine o_machine_oven01 located at workstation o_workstation_1. The following events occurred:

1. **Event 1**: At 10:07:11 UTC, a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_725 and a mass of 0.02118 kg was heated for 900 seconds. The process generated approximately 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions. During this time, the energy consumption from the grid was recorded as 0.02 kWh, with gas input at 0.49392 Wh, which also contributed to emissions of the same amount.

2. **Event 2**: At 10:13:48 UTC, another heating process was executed on a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[753], with a mass of 0.02121 kg. This procedure also lasted 900 seconds, leading to an emission of 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent. Energy consumed included 0.02 kWh from the grid and 0.49392 Wh of gas input.

3. **Event 3**: At 10:15:00 UTC, a heating operation was conducted on steel sheet ID o_steelsheet_758, which weighed 0.02122 kg. Like previous events, this heating lasted for 900 seconds, yielding emissions of approximately 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent, with consumption recorded as 0.02 kWh of electricity and 0.49392 Wh of gas input.

4. **Event 4**: At 10:19:46 UTC, a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_778, weighing 0.02123 kg, was heated for 900 seconds. The heating emitted 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent and recorded 0.02 kWh of electrical energy consumption, along with a gas input that also totaled 0.49392 Wh in emissions.

5. **Event 5**: Finally, at 10:26:10 UTC, a heating process took place for steel sheet ID SteelSheet[805], which had a mass of 0.02124 kg. This event lasted 900 seconds and resulted in emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent. Energy usage reflected 0.02 kWh and 0.49392 Wh of gas input, contributing similarly to emissions.

Throughout all these heating processes, the operational relationship between machine o_machine_oven01 and workstation o_workstation_1 was consistently maintained, with similar energy consumption patterns and emission levels across each event.
