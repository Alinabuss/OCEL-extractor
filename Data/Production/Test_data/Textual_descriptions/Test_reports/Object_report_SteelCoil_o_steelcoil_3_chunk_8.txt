**Combined Report for Object o_steelcoil_3**

On April 4, 2023, multiple splitting operations involving the steel coil identified as o_steelcoil_3, which has a mass of 31.91076 kg, were conducted at Workstation with ID o_workstation_1 using the machine o_machine_splitter01. 

1. The first operation took place at 11:40:30 UTC and lasted approximately 14.567 seconds, resulting in a SteelSheet with ID o_steelsheet_2603 weighing 0.021 kg. This operation emitted 0.0152317038 kg of CO2 equivalent and consumed 0.0222555 kWh of electricity, while generating 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

2. A subsequent operation occurred at 11:43:37 UTC, where the machine operated for 14.15 seconds, producing a SteelSheet labeled SteelSheet[2616] weighing 0.0211 kg. This operation resulted in 0.0148 kg of CO2 emissions, required 0.0216 kWh of energy, and also generated 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

3. At 11:50:04 UTC, another split was performed on a SteelSheet with ID o_steelsheet_2643, lasting approximately 14.5 seconds. It yielded carbon emissions of 0.0152 kg and generated 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

4. Shortly after, at 11:50:18 UTC, the machine executed another splitting task that lasted around 13.7975 seconds, resulting in SteelSheet[2644] with a mass of 0.02109 kg. This process produced 0.01443 kg of CO2 emissions and consumed 0.02108 kWh of electricity, along with an output of 0.00042 kg of steel waste.

5. The final operation was recorded at 11:52:55 UTC, where the machine ran for 14.138 seconds and produced a SteelSheet with ID o_steelsheet_2655 weighing 0.02113 kg. This event emitted 0.0147834786 kg of CO2, utilized 0.0216002 kWh of energy, and also resulted in 0.00042 kg of steel waste designated for recycling.

Throughout the day, all activities involving the splitting of steel sheets from the coil o_steelcoil_3 were synchronized to ensure optimal resource utilization within the manufacturing facility.
