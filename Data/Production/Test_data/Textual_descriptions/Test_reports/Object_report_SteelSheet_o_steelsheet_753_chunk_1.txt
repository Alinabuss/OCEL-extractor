On April 3, 2023, the process involving the object o_steelsheet_753 comprised two key events. 

The first event was a splitting operation that took place at 10:12:52 UTC at Workstation[1], utilizing Machine[splitter01]. This process lasted approximately 14.41 seconds and resulted in the creation of steel sheet ID SteelSheet[753], weighing 0.02121 kg, from steel coil ID SteelCoil[4], which had a mass of 31.91076 kg. The operation emitted 0.01507 kg of CO2e, consumed 0.02201 kWh of electric energy from the grid, and produced 0.00042 kg of steel waste intended for recycling.

Following this, a heating process was conducted at 10:13:48 UTC on the same steel sheet, SteelSheet[753]. This operation took 900 seconds and was performed using Machine[oven01] at the same Workstation[1]. The heating process emitted 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2e and required 0.02 kWh of electricity from the grid, along with 0.49392 Wh of gas input. The emissions from burning the gas accounted for an additional 0.49392 Wh. Throughout this heating event, the mass of the steel sheet remained as 0.02121 kg.
