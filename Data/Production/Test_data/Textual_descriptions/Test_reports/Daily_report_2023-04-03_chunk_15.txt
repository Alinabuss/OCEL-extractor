On April 3, 2023, several processes took place at various workstations, showcasing the production and processing of steel materials. 

At 11:56:40 UTC, a steel sheet with the ID o_steelsheet_1120, weighing 0.02124 kg, served as input for forming a part identified as o_formedpart_1120. This process occurred at workstation o_workstation_1 using machine o_machine_former02. The operation lasted for 5 seconds, resulting in carbon dioxide emissions of 0.0028500228 kg, while consuming 0.0041667 kWh of electricity from the grid.

Shortly after, at 12:00:01 UTC, a different steel sheet, o_steelsheet_1134, which weighed 0.02108 kg, was processed to create another part, o_formedpart_1134, at the same workstation o_workstation_1 and also using machine o_machine_former02. This operation also lasted for 5 seconds, with identical emissions of 0.0028500228 kg and electricity consumption of 0.0041667 kWh.

At 12:02:39 UTC, a heating process for a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_1211, weighing 0.02126 kg, took place at workstation o_workstation_1. This operation, carried out using machine o_machine_oven01, lasted 900 seconds, during which it consumed 0.02 kWh of electricity and produced approximately 0.0138 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions. The heating was additionally recorded to have utilized 0.49392 Wh of gas input, with corresponding emissions from burning being equal to this amount. 

Further activity occurred at 12:07:17 UTC at workstation o_workstation_2, where the machine cutter01 operated to cut a male part, resulting in the creation of malepart_986 and utilizing formed part o_formedpart_986 as input. This cutting process lasted approximately 9.99 seconds, producing emissions of 0.0645 kg of CO2 alongside electricity consumption of 0.0153 kWh, along with the use of 0.056 m³ of compressed air and 0.061 m³ of nitrogen gas. Notably, 0.061 m³ of nitrogen gas was also emitted into the air.

Finally, at 12:08:22 UTC, another steel sheet, identified as o_steelsheet_1235 with a mass of 0.02125 kg, was subjected to heat at workstation o_workstation_1 using machine o_machine_oven01 in a process known as HeatSteelSheet. This operation lasted 900 seconds as well and consumed 0.02 kWh from the grid while utilizing 0.49392 Wh of gas input, resulting in CO2 emissions of approximately 0.0138019093344 kg.

Overall, April 3, 2023, was marked by various activities involving steel processing and machinery operation, highlighting efficiency and emissions across multiple workstations.
