On April 6, 2023, several operations were conducted at two distinct workstations involving various machines and parts. 

At 10:58:57 UTC, a machine identified as Machine[former02] processed a steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[5307] at Workstation[1]. This operation took 5 seconds and resulted in a formed part with ID FormedPart[5307]. The steel sheet had a mass of 0.02123 kg prior to processing, and the operation emitted 0.0028500228 kg of CO₂ while consuming 0.0041667 kWh of electrical energy.

Shortly after, at 10:59:05 UTC, the same workstation (Workstation[1]) and machine (Machine[former02]) were utilized to form another steel sheet, this time with ID SteelSheet[5310]. This operation also lasted for 5 seconds and resulted in the creation of a formed part with ID FormedPart[5310]. The steel sheet weighed 0.02133 kg, and the processing emitted 0.0028500228 kg of CO₂ and consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electricity.

At 11:03:21 UTC, a different machine, Machine[cutter01], was employed at Workstation[2] to cut a female part with ID FemalePart[5022]. This cutting process extended for approximately 12.46 seconds and produced a formed part with ID FormedPart[5022]. It was associated with significant emissions of 0.0887 kg of CO₂, with electricity consumption recorded at 0.019 kWh. Additionally, the operation generated 0.087 cubic meters of compressed air, 0.076 cubic meters of nitrogen gas, and 0.00255 kg of steel waste.

Later, at 11:04:33 UTC, a steel sheet identified as o_steelsheet_5335, weighing 0.02102 kg, was processed using Machine o_machine_former02 at Workstation o_workstation_1. This operation lasted 5 seconds and resulted in a formed part identified as o_formedpart_5335. It produced emissions of approximately 0.0028500228 kg of CO₂ and consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electricity.

Finally, at 11:04:35 UTC, a coating operation was performed on a formed part with the ID o_formedpart_5333, utilizing Machine o_machine_coater03 at workstation ID o_workstation_1. This task took 300 seconds and resulted in the emission of 0.1751156951 kg of CO₂, consumed 0.25 kWh of electricity, and utilized 0.0004 kg of coating material, alongside a waste generation of 0.0001 kg of coating material.

In summary, the events on April 6, 2023, showcase a series of interconnected operations focusing on the processing and transformation of steel sheets and female parts at specific workstations, utilizing various machines to achieve the desired outputs.
