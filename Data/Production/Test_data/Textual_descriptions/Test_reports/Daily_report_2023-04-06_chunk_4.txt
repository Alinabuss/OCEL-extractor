On April 6, 2023, several significant events were recorded. 

At 10:02:01 UTC, a male part with ID malepart_4792 was produced using the machine identified as machine_cutter01 at workstation_2. This cutting process lasted approximately 9.97 seconds and involved an input formed part with ID formedpart_4792. The operation consumed 0.0152 kWh of electricity, 0.06 cubic meters of compressed air, and 0.061 cubic meters of nitrogen gas, while emitting the same volume of nitrogen gas back into the air. The cutting process generated around 0.069 kg of CO2 emissions, although the quantity of steel waste produced remains unspecified.

Shortly after, at 10:04:48 UTC, the same machine (machine_cutter01) was utilized at workstation_2 to process a female part identified as FemalePart[4720]. This operation took 12.62 seconds and produced a formed part with ID FormedPart[4720]. The resources consumed during this process included 0.0192772 kWh of electricity, 0.072 m³ of compressed air, and 0.077 m³ of nitrogen gas, which was also emitted back into the atmosphere, with an emissions output of 0.0824410225778 kg of CO2e and steel waste of 0.00255 kg.

At 10:05:10 UTC, a formed part with ID o_formedpart_5079 underwent a coating process using the machine identified as o_machine_coater03 located at workstation o_workstation_1. This operation lasted 300 seconds, consuming 0.25 kWh of energy and 0.0004 kg of coating material, resulting in 0.1751156951 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions and generating a coating material waste of 0.0001 kg.

Just one second later, at 10:05:11 UTC, machine cutter01 was again employed at workstation 2 to cut a female component identified as FemalePart[4813]. This operation lasted around 12.54 seconds and resulted in the creation of a formed part labeled FormedPart[4813]. During this cutting process, resources included 0.019153 kWh of electricity, 0.072 cubic meters of compressed air, and 0.077 cubic meters of nitrogen gas, with emissions of 0.0836077897778 kg of CO2. The process associated with FemalePart[4813] also produced 0.00255 kg of steel waste. 

Lastly, at 10:12:04 UTC, a formed part with ID o_formedpart_5109 was coated, taking an additional 300 seconds at workstation o_workstation_1 using the same machine o_machine_coater03. The operation consumed 0.25 kWh of electric energy and 0.0004 kg of coating material, with 0.1751156951 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions and 0.0001 kg of coating material waste generated. 

This detailed account encapsulates all operations conducted on April 6, 2023, clearly associating the corresponding resources and emissions with their respective processes.
