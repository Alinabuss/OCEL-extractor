On April 5, 2023, several significant manufacturing operations took place.

At 09:20:54 UTC, a steel sheet identified as o_steelsheet_3420, weighing 0.02113 kg, was processed by the machine labeled o_machine_former02 at workstation o_workstation_1. The operation lasted for 5 seconds, consuming 0.0041667 kWh of electricity and resulting in the creation of a formed part with the ID o_formedpart_3420. This process also generated emissions amounting to 0.0028500228 kg of carbon dioxide equivalent.

Shortly after, at 09:30:37 UTC, a female part denoted as FemalePart[3038] underwent processing by Machine[cutter01] situated at Workstation[2]. This operation produced a formed part with the identification FormedPart[3038] and lasted approximately 12.5 seconds. During this time, the machine utilized 0.0190975 kWh from the grid, alongside consuming 0.065 cubic meters of compressed air and 0.076 cubic meters of nitrogen gas. The process emitted 0.08295 kg of carbon dioxide equivalent, while 0.076 cubic meters of nitrogen gas was released into the air and 0.00257 kg of steel waste was generated.

At 09:47:27 UTC, another steel sheet, weighing 0.02126 kg, was processed at o_workstation_1 using the same machine, o_machine_former02. This operation also lasted 5 seconds, and created an unknown mass formed part identified as o_formedpart_3533. The operation recorded an electricity consumption of 0.0041667 kWh and emitted 0.0028500228 kg of carbon dioxide equivalent, establishing a relationship between the input steel sheet and the output formed part.

Later, at 09:53:20 UTC, the machine Machine[o_machine_cutter01] cut a male part with the ID MalePart[o_malepart_3059 at Workstation[o_workstation_2]. The cutting operation lasted roughly 10.05 seconds, resulting in the output of a formed part identified as FormedPart[o_formedpart_3059]. This process consumed 0.0153548 kWh of electricity and produced emissions of 0.0742344920889 kg of carbon dioxide equivalent. In this operation, 0.072 m³ of compressed air and 0.061 m³ of nitrogen gas were utilized, with the same amount of nitrogen also being emitted into the atmosphere. The mass of steel waste generated in this event remains unknown.

Finally, at 09:59:11 UTC, another cutting operation for a male part occurred, using Machine[1] located at Workstation[2]. This operation lasted for approximately 10.06 seconds and produced a male part identified as MalePart[3387] from the input formed part FormedPart[3387]. During this process, 0.0153734 kWh of electric energy was consumed, alongside 0.067 cubic meters of compressed air and 0.061 cubic meters of nitrogen gas. The cutting operation resulted in an estimated emission of 0.071552 kg of carbon dioxide equivalent, although information regarding any steel waste produced remains unspecified.

These events illustrate a day filled with various processing activities, emphasizing the interconnections between input materials, machines, workstations, and outputs.
