On April 3, 2023, several notable events occurred related to machinery operations and part processing. 

At 11:29:20 UTC, a male part, identified as MalePart[800], was cut using Machine[cutting_cutter01] located at Workstation[workstation_2]. This process began with the input FormedPart[800], lasting approximately 10.01 seconds, during which the operation produced 0.0679 kg of CO2 emissions. Additionally, 0.0153 kWh of electricity was consumed, along with 0.06 m³ of compressed air and 0.061 m³ of nitrogen gas, which was also emitted into the air. Some steel waste was generated, though the exact amount is unspecified.

Shortly thereafter, at 11:30:34 UTC, a forming process was conducted for a steel sheet identified as "o_steelsheet_1010" with a mass of 0.02101 kg, utilizing the machine o_machine_former02 at Workstation ID "o_workstation_1". The forming process resulted in a formed part labeled "o_formedpart_1010," though its mass was unspecified. The operation lasted 5.0 seconds, emitting 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 and consuming approximately 0.0041667 kWh of electricity from the grid.

At 11:31:22 UTC, a FemalePart identified as o_femalepart_722 was processed to yield a FormedPart with ID o_formedpart_722. This cutting operation utilized the machine o_machine_cutter01 at Workstation o_workstation_2, lasting around 12.55 seconds and consuming 0.019 kWh of electricity. During this time, the operation emitted 0.098 kg of CO2e, used 0.104 m³ of compressed air, and utilized 0.077 m³ of nitrogen gas, both of which were also emitted. The process generated a minimal steel waste of 0.00257 kg.

Later, at 11:34:00 UTC, another cutting operation was performed using Machine[cutter01] at Workstation[2]. This operation involved the input FormedPart[663] and resulted in the production of a female part labeled FemalePart[663]. The cutting process took approximately 12.6 seconds, producing 0.083 kg of CO2 emissions, consuming 0.019 kWh of electricity, and utilizing 0.072 m³ of compressed air along with 0.077 m³ of nitrogen gas, which was also emitted. This step generated 0.00251 kg of steel waste.

Finally, at 11:36:14 UTC, the steel sheet identified as "o_steelsheet_1034," weighing 0.02098 kg, was used as input for another forming process conducted with the machine o_machine_former02 at Workstation "o_workstation_1." The operation lasted for 5.0 seconds and generated a CO2 equivalent emission of 0.0028500228 kg while consuming 0.0041667 kWh of energy. The output of this process was a formed part identified as "o_formedpart_1034," created from the input steel sheet.

All these events, taking place on April 3, 2023, reflect a combination of cutting and forming processes carried out at the respective workstations, highlighting efficient resource utilization and emissions monitoring.
