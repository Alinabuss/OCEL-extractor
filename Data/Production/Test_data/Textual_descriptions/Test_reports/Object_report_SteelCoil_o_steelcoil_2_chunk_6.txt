**Report for Object o_steelcoil_2**

On April 5, 2023, the steel coil with ID o_steelcoil_2, weighing approximately 31.91076 kg, was processed multiple times at workstation o_workstation_1 using machine o_machine_splitter01 (also referred to as Splitter01).

1. **First Event**: At 10:45:19 UTC, the splitting operation resulted in a steel sheet (ID: o_steelsheet_3876) with a weight of 0.02122 kg. This process lasted about 13.87 seconds and emitted 0.01450 kg of CO2 equivalent, while producing 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling. The energy consumed during this operation was approximately 0.02119 kWh.

2. **Second Event**: At 10:51:43 UTC, the splitting process produced a steel sheet (ID: o_steelsheet_3876) weighing about 0.02125 kg. This operation took approximately 14.48 seconds and generated around 0.015 kg of CO2 emissions with an energy consumption of about 0.022 kWh, alongside 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

3. **Third Event**: At 10:57:40 UTC, another operation on the same steel coil generated a steel sheet (ID: o_steelsheet_3901) weighing 0.02132 kg. The process lasted for 14.265 seconds, emitted 0.014916243 kg of CO2, and drew approximately 0.0217943 kWh of electricity from the grid. It also resulted in 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

4. **Fourth Event**: At 11:31:07 UTC, a further operation on the steel coil produced a steel sheet (ID: o_steelsheet_4042) weighing 0.02128 kg. This operation took about 14.42 seconds and resulted in 0.01508 kg of CO2 emissions while consuming approximately 0.02203 kWh of electric energy, alongside 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

5. **Fifth Event**: Finally, at 11:33:15 UTC, a splitting operation on the same coil resulted in the creation of a steel sheet (ID: SteelSheet[4051]) weighing 0.02115 kg. The operation lasted approximately 14.973 seconds, generated 0.015656 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions, and consumed around 0.0228759 kWh of electricity from the grid. The event also produced 0.00042 kg of steel waste designated for recycling.

Throughout these events, the steel coil o_steelcoil_2 was consistently utilized, demonstrating its involvement in various splitting operations conducted at the workstation.
