On April 6, 2023, several processes took place at different timestamps, primarily involving various formed parts and machines at specific workstations. 

At 10:29:26 UTC, a coating process was performed on a formed part with ID o_formedpart_5186. This task was completed using the machine identified as o_machine_coater03 located at workstation ID o_workstation_1. The process lasted 300 seconds, during which it consumed 0.25 kWh of electricity and produced a carbon dioxide equivalent emission of approximately 0.1751 kg. Additionally, the total amount of coating material used was 0.0004 kg, while the waste generated reached 0.0001 kg.

Shortly after, at 10:31:51 UTC, another coating process occurred involving a different formed part, labeled o_formedpart_5194. This second task also lasted 300 seconds and was executed at the same workstation (o_workstation_1) with the same machine (o_machine_coater03). It similarly consumed 0.25 kWh of energy and generated 0.1751156951 kg of CO2e, with the same quantities of coating material and waste as the previous task.

At 10:36:11 UTC, the machine labeled o_machine_cutter01 located at workstation ID o_workstation_2 performed a cutting activity, resulting in a male part, marked as o_malepart_4917, created from the formed part identified as o_formedpart_4917. This cutting process took approximately 10.02 seconds and emitted 0.06356 kg of CO2 equivalent. It consumed about 0.01531 kWh of electricity, used 0.055 m³ of compressed air, and 0.061 m³ of gas nitrogen, releasing the same volume of nitrogen gas into the air. Details regarding any steel waste generated were not specified.

Following this, at 10:40:17 UTC, the machine identified as o_machine_former02 at workstation ID o_workstation_1 formed a steel sheet, which had an ID of o_steelsheet_5234 and weighed 0.02129 kg. This process lasted for 5 seconds and resulted in the creation of a formed part designated as o_formedpart_5234, producing minimal carbon emissions of 0.0028500228 kg CO2e and consuming approximately 0.0041667 kWh of electricity.

Finally, at 10:42:02 UTC, another forming process took place at workstation ID o_workstation_1 using machine o_machine_former02. A steel sheet weighing 0.02131 kg was transformed into a formed part, with the operation also lasting 5 seconds and emitting 0.0028500228 kg of CO2. The machine's electric consumption was consistent with previous processes, illustrating the efficiency and continuity of operations on this date.
