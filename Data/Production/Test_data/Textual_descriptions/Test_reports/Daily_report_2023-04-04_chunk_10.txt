On April 4, 2023, a series of operations were conducted involving various machines and workstations. At 12:08:56 UTC, the machine with ID "o_machine_former02" was utilized at workstation ID "o_workstation_1" to form a steel sheet identified as "o_steelsheet_2650," which had a mass of 0.02111 kg. This forming process lasted 5 seconds, resulting in a formed part with ID "o_formedpart_2650." During this operation, it emitted approximately 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 and consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electric energy, while the formed part itself did not have a recorded mass.

Shortly after, at 12:16:40 UTC, the same machine, now referred to as Machine[former02] at Workstation[1], processed a different steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[2681], which weighed 0.02123 kg. This operation also took 5 seconds, producing a formed part identified as FormedPart[2681]. It was recorded that the energy consumed during this process was 0.0041667 kWh, with carbon dioxide emissions equivalent to 0.0028500228 kg.

At 12:17:27 UTC, a new input steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[2683] and a weight of 0.02131 kg was used in the same process on Machine[former02] at Workstation[1]. This 5-second forming operation resulted in the output of a formed part with ID FormedPart[2683]. Similar to the previous operations, 0.0041667 kWh of electricity was consumed, and emissions of 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 were recorded.

Later, at 12:22:39 UTC, the machine identified as "o_machine_cutter01," located at workstation "o_workstation_2," operated to cut an input formed part labeled "o_formedpart_2320." The cutting process took approximately 9.92 seconds and resulted in the production of a male part with ID "o_malepart_2320." This operation consumed about 0.0152 kWh of electricity and utilized 0.06 m³ of compressed air and 0.061 m³ of nitrogen gas, while emitting the same volume of nitrogen gas. Carbon dioxide emissions during this task were around 0.0662 kg, however, details regarding the mass of steel waste produced were not specified.

Finally, at 12:22:49 UTC, the cutting operation continued with processing a female part identified as "o_femalepart_2227," which resulted in a formed part with ID "o_formedpart_2227." This operation took about 12.50 seconds, consuming 0.0191 kWh of electricity, 0.08 m³ of compressed air, and 0.076 m³ of nitrogen gas—also emitted into the atmosphere. Additionally, this process generated 0.00254 kg of steel waste and resulted in CO2 emissions of 0.0851 kg, again carried out on the machine "o_machine_cutter01" at workstation "o_workstation_2." 

Overall, the activities performed on April 4, 2023, highlight a series of efficient processes focused on shaping and cutting steel parts while monitoring energy consumption and emissions.
