On April 5, 2023, a series of operations took place across various workstations, involving multiple machines and components. 

At 11:01:30 UTC, a cutting process involving Machine[3457] at Workstation[2] resulted in the production of a MalePart with ID MalePart[3457]. This operation utilized the input from a FormedPart with ID FormedPart[3457] and lasted approximately 9.93 seconds, generating 0.0646 kg of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. The machine consumed around 0.0152 kWh of electricity and used 0.056 m続 of compressed air and 0.061 m続 of nitrogen gas, with an equivalent amount being emitted to the air. The operation also generated unspecified steel waste.

Shortly after, at 11:02:57 UTC, Machine[former02] at Workstation[1] processed a steel sheet weighing 0.02118 kg into a formed part. This forming operation took 5.0 seconds and produced 0.0028500228 kg of carbon dioxide emissions, while consuming 0.0041667 kWh of electricity from the grid. The formed part created in this activity was derived from the initially mentioned steel sheet.

Just a moment later, at 11:03:09 UTC, Cutter[01] at Workstation[2] processed a female part with ID FemalePart[3480] into a formed part with ID FormedPart[3480]. This cutting process lasted approximately 12.55 seconds, generating 0.0916 kg of carbon dioxide emissions. The operation consumed 0.0192 kWh of electricity, utilized 0.086 m続 of compressed air and 0.077 m続 of nitrogen gas, and emitted the same volume into the air. Moreover, 0.00255 kg of steel waste was produced. Notably, the relationship between the female part and the formed part is direct.

Later, at 11:11:37 UTC, a machine identified as o_machine_cutter01 processed a formed part with ID o_formedpart_3568 to create a male part with ID o_malepart_3568. This cutting operation, labeled CuttMalePart, took approximately 10.014 seconds, resulting in 0.067719 kg of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. During this process, it consumed 0.0152999 kilowatt-hours of electricity, 0.057 cubic meters of compressed air, and 0.061 cubic meters of nitrogen gas, with an equal amount of nitrogen being emitted to the air. Although steel waste was generated, the specific amount remains unspecified. The operation was conducted at workstation labeled o_workstation_2.

Finally, at 11:14:17 UTC, another operation using Machine[form02] at Workstation[1] involved the input of a steel sheet weighing 0.0212 kg. This forming process, which lasted for 5 seconds, resulted in the creation of a formed part and emitted 0.0028500228 kg of carbon dioxide. Additionally, it consumed approximately 0.0041667 kWh of electricity from the grid. The formed part produced was derived from the steel sheet used in the input, reinforcing the connection between these components.

Overall, April 5, 2023, was marked by efficient processing of various parts across workstations, showcasing the interrelationships between input materials, formed components, and the cutting operations that created them.
