**Summary Report for Object o_machine_splitter01**

On April 3, 2023, the machine designated as "o_machine_splitter01," located at workstation "o_workstation_1," performed several splitting operations on steel coils throughout the day:

1. **First Operation**: At **11:08:54 UTC**, the machine split steel coil **o_steelcoil_4**, resulting in the creation of steel sheet **o_steelsheet_989**. This process lasted for approximately **14.24 seconds**, emitting **0.0148857366 kg** of CO2e and consuming **0.0217497 kWh** of electricity from the grid. The operation generated **0.00042 kg** of recyclable steel waste. The steel coil had a mass of **31.91076 kg**, and the resulting steel sheet weighed **0.02119 kg**.

2. **Second Operation**: Subsequently, at **11:15:47 UTC**, the machine executed another splitting process on the same steel coil, that is **SteelCoil[4]**, producing steel sheet **SteelSheet[1018]**. This operation lasted about **14.74 seconds**, emitting **0.01541 kg** of CO2 and consuming **0.02252 kWh** of electricity. Similarly, it resulted in **0.00042 kg** of steel waste intended for recycling. The steel sheet created from this action had a mass of **0.0212 kg**.

3. **Third Operation**: At **11:23:13 UTC**, the machine processed the steel coil **o_steelcoil_4** again, yielding steel sheet **o_steelsheet_1049**. This split lasted for about **14.48 seconds**, with CO2 equivalent emissions of **0.01514 kg** and electricity consumption of **0.02212 kWh**. The operation generated another **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling. The created steel sheet weighed **0.02128 kg**.

4. **Fourth Operation**: Later, at **11:34:20 UTC**, the machine performed yet another split operation at workstation **o_workstation_1**, producing steel sheet **o_steelsheet_1096** from steel coil **ID 4**. This operation took approximately **14.49 seconds** and emitted **0.0151513338 kg** of CO2e while consuming **0.022138 kWh** of electricity. A consistent output was observed, with **0.00042 kg** of steel waste marked for recycling.

5. **Fifth Operation**: Finally, at **11:42:39 UTC**, a splitting process was conducted using steel coil **SteelCoil[4]**, resulting in the creation of steel sheet **SteelSheet[1131]**. This operation lasted around **13.92 seconds**, producing a CO2 equivalent emission of **0.01456 kg** and consuming **0.02127 kWh** of electricity. As with the previous operations, it resulted in **0.00042 kg** of steel waste intended for recycling.

Throughout the day on April 3, 2023, the "o_machine_splitter01" efficiently executed multiple operations, showcasing consistent performance and emissions across its tasks involving the same steel coil, **o_steelcoil_4**.
