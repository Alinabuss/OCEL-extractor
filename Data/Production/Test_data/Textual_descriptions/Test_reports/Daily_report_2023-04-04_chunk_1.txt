On April 4, 2023, several significant processes occurred involving steel sheets at Workstation[1] utilizing various machines. 

At 07:49:12 UTC, the heating process for the steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_1567 commenced on Workstation[1] using Machine[oven01]. This heating lasted for 900 seconds, resulting in emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent, with an electricity consumption of 0.02 kWh and a gas input of 0.49392 Wh, also generating an emission of 0.49392 Wh associated with burning. The mass of the steel sheet was 0.02128 kg.

Shortly afterward, at 07:54:14 UTC, another steel sheet, identified as o_steelsheet_1613 and weighing 0.02125 kg, underwent the same heating process on Workstation[1] with Machine[oven01]. This process also lasted for 900 seconds and resulted in similar emissions: 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent, a consumption of 0.02 kWh of electricity from the grid, and 0.49392 Wh of gas input, culminating in an equivalent burning emission of 0.49392 Wh.

At 07:55:02 UTC, heating of yet another steel sheet, identified as SteelSheet[1620], was initiated under the same conditions as earlier events, lasting for 900 seconds and resulting in the same emissions and energy consumption figures.

Following these heating processes, at 07:59:22 UTC, a steel sheet weighing 0.0212 kg was processed into a formed part using Machine[former02] at Workstation[1]. This transformation took 5 seconds, generating 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 equivalent and consuming 0.0041667 kWh from the grid, marking a successful change in the production cycle.

Lastly, at 08:00:32 UTC, heating of a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[1669] was conducted at Workstation[1] by Machine[oven01]. This operation, lasting another 900 seconds, resulted once more in an emission of 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent. The process drew electricity from the grid amounting to 0.02 kWh and included a gas input of 0.49392 Wh, producing a corresponding emission of 0.49392 Wh. The mass of SteelSheet[1669] was recorded as 0.02122 kg. 

This compilation illustrates the interconnected heating processes and transformations that took place within the production cycle on April 4, 2023.
