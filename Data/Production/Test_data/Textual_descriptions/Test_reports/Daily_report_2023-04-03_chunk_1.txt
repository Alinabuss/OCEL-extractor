On April 3, 2023, a series of notable coating processes occurred at Workstation[1], involving various formed parts and machines. 

At 07:56:25 UTC, a coating process was completed utilizing o_machine_coater03 to coat a formed part with ID o_formedpart_5. The operation lasted for 300 seconds, consuming 0.25 kWh of electrical energy and generating approximately 0.1751 kg of CO2e emissions. The amount of coating material used was 0.0004 kg, while 0.0001 kg of waste was produced. 

Shortly after, at 07:56:37 UTC, the same workstation was employed for a similar task where FormedPart[8] was coated using Machine[coater03]. This operation mirrored the previous one, lasting 300 seconds with identical energy and emission outputs: 0.25 kWh energy consumption and 0.1751156951 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions, alongside the use of 0.0004 kg of coating material and the generation of 0.0001 kg of waste.

At 08:03:25 UTC, another coating process took place on a formed part labeled FormedPart[66]. Conducted at Workstation[1] using Machine[coater03], the operation again lasted 300 seconds, with emissions of approximately 0.175 kg of CO2, 0.25 kWh of energy consumption, and the same amounts of coating material and waste generated: 0.0004 kg and 0.0001 kg, respectively.

During the same timeframe, at 08:04:36 UTC, a coating process was carried out on o_formedpart_71 at Workstation[1]. This operation, also utilizing o_machine_coater03, followed the same specifications: a duration of 300 seconds, energy consumption of 0.25 kWh, CO2 emissions of 0.1751156951 kg, and the use of 0.0004 kg coating material with 0.0001 kg waste.

Lastly, at 08:04:38 UTC, a steel sheet with the ID SteelSheet[81], weighing 0.02097 kg, was processed for 5 seconds. This operation resulted in the output of FormedPart[81], which consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electricity and produced 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions. The processing of the steel sheet occurred at Workstation[1], utilizing Machine[former02]. 

Throughout these activities on April 3, 2023, the efficiency and consistency of the coating processes at Workstation[1] were noteworthy, marked by uniform energy consumption and emissions across several formed parts.
