On April 4, 2023, a series of cutting operations were performed using the machine identified as Machine[o_machine_cutter01] located at Workstation[o_workstation_2].

The first operation occurred at 14:08:44 UTC, lasting approximately 9.95 seconds. It involved cutting to create a male part identified as MalePart[o_malepart_2823], which was derived from the formed part labeled FormedPart[o_formedpart_2823]. During this activity, 0.015195 kWh of electricity was consumed from the grid, along with 0.065 m³ of compressed air and 0.061 m³ of nitrogen gas. The operation resulted in emissions of 0.061 m³ of nitrogen gas and produced a CO2 equivalent of 0.0705 kg. The quantity of steel waste managed during this process was not recorded.

Shortly after, at 14:09:07 UTC, the machine processed another task, producing a male part identified as MalePart[o_malepart_2597]. This operation took approximately 9.9 seconds and utilized the FormedPart identified as o_formedpart_2597 as an input. The process resulted in CO2 emissions estimated at 0.068 kg, with energy consumption of 0.0151235 kWh and usage of 0.067 m³ of compressed air and 0.06 m³ of nitrogen gas, which was also emitted. Again, the amount of steel waste generated was not specified.

At 14:15:07 UTC, another cutting operation was performed, which aimed to produce a male part identified as MalePart[2659]. This task lasted approximately 10.073 seconds and utilized the FormedPart[2659] as an input. The operation resulted in CO2 emissions of 0.0686235140444 kg and consumed 0.0153894 kWh of energy, with 0.057 m³ of compressed air and 0.062 m³ of nitrogen gas being used. The nitrogen gas was subsequently emitted into the air, and the mass of the resulting male part was unspecified.

Following this, at 14:16:15 UTC, another male part was produced, labeled MalePart[2642], with the formed part input being FormedPart[2642]. This operation lasted for 9.969 seconds, resulting in emissions of 0.0686916296889 kg of CO2 equivalent. The machine consumed 0.0152312 kWh of electricity, along with 0.064 m³ of compressed air and 0.061 m³ of nitrogen gas, which was also emitted. Like previous operations, the mass of the male part created and the amount of steel waste generated during this task were not detailed.

Finally, at 14:20:09 UTC, a cutting operation for a female part was executed, leading to the production of FemalePart[2793]. This process lasted approximately 12.41 seconds and emitted 0.084 kg of CO2 equivalent. The machine consumed 0.0189653 kWh of energy, utilized 0.074 m³ of compressed air, and used 0.076 m³ of nitrogen gas, which was also emitted. Notably, 0.00255 kg of steel waste was recorded from this operation, with FormedPart[2793] being used as input.

In summary, the events on April 4, 2023, highlight the significant activities and emissions associated with the cutting processes at Workstation[o_workstation_2], utilizing Machine[o_machine_cutter01].
