**Report for Object ID: o_workstation_1**

On April 6, 2023, several operations took place at workstation ID o_workstation_1, involving steel sheets and machines.

1. **Heating Process**: A heating operation was conducted for a steel sheet (ID: o_steelsheet_5032) starting at 09:36:50 UTC. This process lasted for 900 seconds, utilizing machine oven (ID: o_machine_oven01). During the heating, the process recorded CO2 equivalent emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg and consumed 0.02 kWh of electricity from the grid, along with a gas input of 0.49392 Wh, which also led to an equivalent emission of 0.49392 Wh. The steel sheet had a mass of 0.02127 kg.

2. **Splitting Operation**: A splitter machine (ID: splitter01) was utilized at 09:42:45 UTC to split a steel sheet, producing a new sheet (ID: o_steelsheet_5061) with a mass of 0.02113 kg. This operation lasted approximately 14.10 seconds and used a steel coil (ID: o_steelcoil_1) weighing 31.91076 kg as input. The process emitted 0.01475 kg of CO2 equivalent and resulted in a steel waste recycling output of 0.00042 kg.

3. **Heating Process**: Another heating operation occurred at 09:46:30 UTC for a steel sheet (ID: SteelSheet[5073]), lasting 900 seconds. The operation again produced 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 emissions while using 0.02 kWh of electricity and 0.49392 Wh of gas input, resulting in identical emissions from the burn. This operation was conducted at workstation ID o_workstation_1, utilizing machine oven (ID: o_machine_oven01).

4. **Another Splitting Operation**: At 09:50:06 UTC, a SplitSteelSheet operation was performed using machine splitter01, which involved the steel coil (ID: SteelCoil[1]) weighing 31.91076 kg as input. This operation produced a steel sheet (ID: SteelSheet[5092]) with a mass of 0.02108 kg and had a duration of approximately 14.413 seconds. The process emitted around 0.015 kg of CO2 equivalent and consumed approximately 0.022 kWh of electricity from the grid, while generating a minimal amount of 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

5. **Final Heating Process**: Lastly, at 09:55:32 UTC, heating took place for a steel sheet (ID: SteelSheet[5111]) with a mass of 0.02123 kg. This heating process also lasted for 900 seconds, producing 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 emissions. The energy consumption included 0.02 kWh from the grid, alongside a gas input and burn emission of 0.49392 Wh, recorded at workstation ID o_workstation_1 with machine oven (ID: o_machine_oven01).

All operations were executed at workstation ID o_workstation_1 on the same day, underscoring the station's role in processing and manufacturing steel sheets.
