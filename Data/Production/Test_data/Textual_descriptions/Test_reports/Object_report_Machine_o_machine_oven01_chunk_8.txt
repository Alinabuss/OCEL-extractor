**Report for Object o_machine_oven01**

On April 4, 2023, the machine labeled o_machine_oven01, located at workstation o_workstation_1, was involved in a series of heating processes for various steel sheets.

1. **Event 1**: At 08:36:41 UTC, the heating process for steel sheet ID SteelSheet[1824] commenced, lasting 900 seconds. During this time, the sheet had a mass of 0.02109 kg. The process consumed 0.02 kWh of electricity from the grid and utilized 0.49392 Wh of gas input, resulting in 0.49392 Wh of emissions from burning. The total carbon dioxide equivalent emission recorded was 0.0138019093344 kg.

2. **Event 2**: Following this, at 08:39:33 UTC, another heating was initiated for steel sheet ID SteelSheet[1836], also for a duration of 900 seconds. This operation consumed the same energy amounts, with emissions of 0.49392 Wh and a carbon dioxide equivalent of 0.0138019093344 kg.

3. **Event 3**: At 08:50:51 UTC, the heating process for steel sheet ID SteelSheet[1884] took place, continuing for 900 seconds. The energy consumption and emissions remained consistent, with 0.02 kWh from the grid and 0.49392 Wh from gas resulting in 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent.

4. **Event 4**: Shortly after, at 08:51:08 UTC, the heating process for steel sheet ID o_steelsheet_1885 occurred. This sheet weighed 0.02125 kg and the parameters of the process mirrored the previous events, lasting 900 seconds and producing 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent with 0.02 kWh of electricity used and 0.49392 Wh of gas consumed.

5. **Event 5**: Finally, at 08:55:38 UTC, steel sheet ID o_steelsheet_1904, weighing 0.02121 kg, was heated for 900 seconds under the same conditions. The process resulted in an emission of 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent, 0.02 kWh from the grid, and 0.49392 Wh from gas.

Throughout these events, the heating processes consistently demonstrated the same energy consumption and emission patterns, highlighting the operational efficiency of the machine o_machine_oven01 at workstation o_workstation_1.
