On April 6, 2023, multiple operations took place, involving several machines and formed parts. 

At 10:19:01 UTC, a formed part with the ID o_formedpart_5136 underwent a coating process at workstation ID o_workstation_1, which is located at the machine ID o_machine_coater03. This operation lasted for 300 seconds and utilized 0.25 kWh of electric energy from the grid. The process involved 0.0004 kg of coating material and resulted in the generation of 0.0001 kg of coating material waste. The total CO2 equivalent emissions for this event were recorded at 0.1751156951 kg.

Shortly after, at 10:27:12 UTC, Machine[former02] was utilized at Workstation[1] to process a SteelSheet with ID SteelSheet[5175], which had a mass of 0.02116 kg. This operation lasted for 5 seconds and resulted in a formed part identified as FormedPart[5175]. The energy consumption for this operation was 0.0041667 kWh, with carbon dioxide equivalent emissions measured at 0.0028500228 kg. The formed part was created from the steel sheet using resources available at the specified workstation.

At 10:28:16 UTC, another formed part labeled o_formedpart_5180 underwent a coating process at workstation ID o_workstation_1, again utilizing machine o_machine_coater03. This operation mirrored the first coating process, lasting for 300 seconds and producing 0.1751156951 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions. During this time, 0.25 kWh of electric energy was consumed, with inputs of 0.0004 kg of coating material and generation of 0.0001 kg of coating waste.

At 10:28:28 UTC, a cutting operation took place using machine o_machine_cutter01 located at workstation ID o_workstation_2. The operation, which lasted approximately 12.48 seconds, involved cutting a formed part identified as o_formedpart_4975 to produce a female part labeled o_femalepart_4975. This process generated CO2 emissions of 0.07777 kg, consumed 0.019073 kWh of electricity, and utilized 0.059 m続 of compressed air along with 0.076 m続 of nitrogen gas, emitting the same quantity of nitrogen gas into the air. The operation also resulted in the production of approximately 0.00254 kg of steel waste.

Finally, at 10:29:13 UTC, a female part identified as FemalePart[4885] was processed using machine Machine[cutter01] at Workstation[2]. This cutting operation, lasting approximately 12.46 seconds, generated emissions of 0.08666 kg of CO2 equivalent and consumed 0.0190379 kWh from the grid. The process involved the use of 0.078 m続 of compressed air and 0.076 m続 of nitrogen gas, which was also released into the air equivalently. Upon completion of this operation, a formed part labeled FormedPart[4885] was created.
