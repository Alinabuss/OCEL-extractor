On April 5, 2023, several operations were conducted at workstation ID o_workstation_2 involving a machine identified as cutter01 (ID o_machine_cutter01). 

The first operation occurred at 13:48:20 UTC, where the machine cut a male part with input ID o_malepart_4114, resulting in a formed part with ID o_formedpart_4114. This process lasted approximately 9.95 seconds and consumed 0.0152043 kWh of electricity, 0.067 m³ of compressed air, and 0.061 m³ of nitrogen gas. The operation emitted the same amount of nitrogen along with a carbon dioxide equivalent of 0.0697 kg; however, the amount of steel waste generated remains unspecified.

Following this, another male part was processed at 14:00:20 UTC using cutter01. This operation lasted for about 10.05 seconds and involved the input of a male part yielding an output male part with ID o_malepart_4417 and a formed part ID o_formedpart_4417. The energy consumed included 0.0154 kWh of electricity, 0.069 m³ of compressed air, and 0.061 m³ of nitrogen gas, which similarly resulted in nitrogen emissions. The carbon dioxide equivalent for this event was approximately 0.0701 kg.

A cutting operation of a female part took place at 14:03:30 UTC, lasting 12.49 seconds. This process involved cutter01 and consumed 0.0191 kWh of electricity, 0.089 m³ of compressed air, and 0.076 m³ of nitrogen gas, with corresponding nitrogen emissions of 0.076 m³. The output was a formed part, and the operation resulted in a carbon dioxide equivalent emission of 0.0922 kg
