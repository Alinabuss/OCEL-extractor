**Report for Object o_steelcoil_1**

On April 6, 2023, several operations were conducted involving steel coil ID SteelCoil[1] and resulted in the creation of multiple steel sheets.

1. At **10:58:20 UTC**, a steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[5380], weighing **0.02117 kg**, was created from SteelCoil[1], which weighs **31.91076 kg**. This operation, performed using machine ID Machine[splitter01] at workstation ID Workstation[1], took **13.825 seconds** and emitted **0.0144564582 kg** of CO2. It consumed **0.0211221 kWh** of electric energy and produced **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling.

2. Shortly after, at **10:59:02 UTC**, workstation ID "o_workstation_1" utilized machine ID "o_machine_splitter01" to split a steel sheet identified as "o_steelsheet_5383," also derived from SteelCoil[1]. This process lasted approximately **13.80 seconds**, producing **0.01443 kg** of CO2 and generating **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling. The electric consumption recorded was **0.0210835 kWh**.

3. At **11:11:42 UTC**, the same machine (Machine[o_machine_splitter01], located at Workstation[o_workstation_1]) conducted another splitting operation on SteelCoil[o_steelcoil_1]. This operation resulted in the production of SteelSheet[o_steelsheet_5436] with a mass of **0.02118 kg**. The operation duration was **14.3912478204 seconds**, emitting **0.0150477762 kg** of CO2, while consuming **0.0219866 kWh** of electric power and generating **0.00042 kg** of steel waste intended for recycling.

4. The next operation occurred at **11:15:16 UTC**, involving the same machine and workstation. During this split operation, SteelCoil[1] was utilized to produce SteelSheet[5451] with a weight of **0.0213 kg**. This process took approximately **13.92 seconds** and resulted in **0.01455 kg** of CO2 emissions. It consumed **0.0212621 kWh** from the grid and generated **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling.

5. Finally, at **11:18:49 UTC**, Machine[Splitter01] processed SteelCoil[1] again at Workstation[1]. A new steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[5466], weighing **0.02122 kg**, was created. This operation lasted about **14.26 seconds**, generated **0.01491 kg** of CO2 emissions, and produced **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling, using **0.02178 kWh** of electric energy from the grid.

Throughout these operations, the steel coil continued to facilitate the production of various steel sheets while contributing to emissions, energy consumption, and waste generation, all earmarked for recycling.
