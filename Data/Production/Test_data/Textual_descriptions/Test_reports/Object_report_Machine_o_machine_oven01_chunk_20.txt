**Report on Heating Processes Involving Object o_machine_oven01**

Date: April 5, 2023

1. **Event 1**: On April 5, 2023, at 12:11:36 UTC, o_machine_oven01 performed a heating process on a steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[4209], weighing 0.02129 kg. The operation lasted for 900 seconds, resulting in an emission of 0.0138019093344 kg CO2 equivalent. During this period, 0.02 kWh of electricity was consumed from the grid, and there was a gas input of 0.49392 Wh, with corresponding burn emissions also measuring 0.49392 Wh. This heating occurred at Workstation[1].

2. **Event 2**: Shortly after, at 12:19:29 UTC, o_machine_oven01 processed another steel sheet, this time with ID 4242, which weighed 0.02124 kg. This operation also lasted for 900 seconds, generating an emission of 0.0138019093344 kg CO2. The machine consumed the same amount of electricity from the grid (0.02 kWh) and an identical gas input of 0.49392 Wh. The heating occurred at Workstation[1].

3. **Event 3**: Later that day, at 12:55:53 UTC, a different steel sheet, ID o_steelsheet_4395, with a mass of 0.02101 kg, underwent heating with o_machine_oven01. This process, lasting for 900 seconds, produced 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent, consumed 0.02 kWh of electric energy, and involved 0.49392 Wh of gas input, along with the same amount of burn emissions. This operation took place at o_workstation_1.

4. **Event 4**: At 13:02:59 UTC, another heating event was conducted on a steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[4425], which had a mass of 0.02107 kg. The heating lasted for 900 seconds, resulting in CO2 equivalent emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg. The electricity consumption was recorded at 0.02 kWh, and the gas input was again 0.49392 Wh, along with equivalent emissions from the burn. This heating also occurred at Workstation[1].

5. **Event 5**: Finally, at 13:03:58 UTC, o_machine_oven01 was involved in heating a steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[4429], weighing 0.02118 kg. This operation labeled as HeatSteelSheet lasted for 900 seconds, producing 0.0138019093344 kg of carbon emissions. The energy consumption remained consistent at 0.02 kWh for electricity from the grid, with a gas input of 0.49392 Wh and identical burn emissions. This heating took place at Workstation[1].

Throughout these events, o_machine_oven01 consistently operated at Workstation[1], highlighting its role in the heating processes of various steel sheets on April 5, 2023.
