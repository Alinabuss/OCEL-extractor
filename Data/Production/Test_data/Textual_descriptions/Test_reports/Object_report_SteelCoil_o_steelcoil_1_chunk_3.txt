**Report on Object o_steelcoil_1**

On April 6, 2023, o_steelcoil_1, weighing 31.91076 kg, underwent multiple processing events at Workstation 1 utilizing the machine identified as Splitter01 (also referred to as machine_splitter01). 

1. **First Splitting Event:**
   - **Timestamp:** 09:33:59 UTC
   - The coil was processed to create a steel sheet with ID 5024, weighing 0.02123 kg. 
   - This operation lasted 14.4085 seconds, emitting approximately 0.0150658 kg of CO2 and generating 0.00042 kg of steel waste intended for recycling. 
   - The electric energy input utilized during this process was 0.022013 kWh.

2. **Second Splitting Event:**
   - **Timestamp:** 09:35:39 UTC
   - The same coil (o_steelcoil_1) was involved in the creation of a steel sheet with ID steelsheet_5031, weighing 0.02096 kg. 
   - This process took around 13.90 seconds, producing about 0.01454 kg of CO2 and generating 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling. 
   - The operation consumed 0.02124 kWh of electricity.

3. **Third Splitting Event:**
   - **Timestamp:** 09:42:45 UTC
   - The machine Splitter01 processed the steel coil to create another steel sheet, identified as o_steelsheet_5061, with a mass of 0.02113 kg. 
   - This operation's duration was approximately 14.10 seconds, resulting in an emission of 0.01475 kg of CO2 and producing 0.00042 kg of steel waste. 

4. **Fourth Splitting Event:**
   - **Timestamp:** 09:50:06 UTC
   - A SplitSteelSheet operation was performed producing a steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[5092], weighing 0.02108 kg. 
   - This process took about 14.413 seconds, emitting around 0.015 kg of CO2 and consuming approximately 0.022 kWh of electricity while generating 0.00042 kg of steel waste.

5. **Fifth Splitting Event:**
   - **Timestamp:** 09:59:48 UTC
   - Finally, the coil was used once more to split and produce a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[5133], which weighed 0.02154 kg. 
   - This process lasted 14.0938 seconds and resulted in CO2 emissions of 0.014737 kg, consuming 0.0215323 kWh of electricity, and generating 0.00042 kg of steel waste.

Throughout the day, o_steelcoil_1 was pivotal in generating numerous refined steel sheets, while managing CO2 emissions and recycling outputs effectively across all operations.
