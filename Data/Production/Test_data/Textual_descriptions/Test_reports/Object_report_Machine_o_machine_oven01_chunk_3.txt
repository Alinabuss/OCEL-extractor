**Heating Process Report for Object o_machine_oven01**

On April 3, 2023, the machine identified as o_machine_oven01, located at workstation o_workstation_1, was involved in multiple heating processes for various steel sheets.

1. **Event 1**: At 09:34:25 UTC, a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_587, weighing 0.02124 kg, underwent a heating process that lasted for 900 seconds. This process resulted in CO2 equivalent emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg, with an energy consumption of 0.02 kWh from the electrical grid and a gas input of 0.49392 Wh, mirrored by emissions from burning.

2. **Event 2**: Shortly after, at 09:41:49 UTC, another steel sheet, SteelSheet[618], weighing 0.0209 kg, was heated for 900 seconds using the same machine. This operation produced identical emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent, with energy consumption from the grid recorded at 0.02 kWh, and a gas input of 0.49392 Wh, alongside equivalent emissions from burning.

3. **Event 3**: At 09:49:55 UTC, the machine was again utilized to heat a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_652, weighing 0.0213 kg. This heating process also lasted for 900 seconds, resulting in CO2 emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg. The energy consumption from the grid was 0.02 kWh, and gas input and emissions from burning were recorded at 0.49392 Wh each.

4. **Event 4**: The heating processes continued at 09:55:35 UTC, when a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[676] was heated at workstation o_workstation_1 for 900 seconds. This process yielded the same CO2 equivalent emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg, with energy consumption from the grid at 0.02 kWh, along with a gas input and burning emissions both at 0.49392 Wh.

5. **Event 5**: Lastly, at 10:04:32 UTC, a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_714, weighing 0.02122 kg, underwent heating for 900 seconds using the machine o_machine_oven01. This operation produced CO2 equivalent emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg, with an electrical consumption from the grid of 0.02 kWh, and gas input and emissions from burning recorded at 0.49392 Wh.

Throughout these operations, the machine o_machine_oven01 consistently demonstrated the same performance metrics, emphasizing its reliability and efficiency in heating steel sheets at workstation o_workstation_1.
