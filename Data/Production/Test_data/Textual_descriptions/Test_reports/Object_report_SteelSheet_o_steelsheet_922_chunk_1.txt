On April 3, 2023, at 10:52:59 UTC, a workstation with ID Workstation[1] performed a split on a steel coil identified as SteelCoil[4] using Machine[splitter01]. This operation, named SplitSteelSheet, lasted approximately 14.87 seconds and resulted in the creation of a steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[922], which has a mass of 0.02101 kg. The process consumed 0.02271 kWh of electrical energy and generated 0.01554 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions. Additionally, there was a production of 0.00042 kg of steel waste, which is intended for recycling, reflecting the material transformation from the original steel coil.
