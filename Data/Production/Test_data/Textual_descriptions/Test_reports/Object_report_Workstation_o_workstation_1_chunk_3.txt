On April 3, 2023, a series of heating processes took place at Workstation[o_workstation_1], utilizing the machine identified as Machine[o_machine_oven01]. 

1. At **08:34:02 UTC**, the first heating operation involved a steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[o_steelsheet_332], which weighed **0.0212 kg**. This process lasted for **900 seconds**, generating approximately **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2 equivalent emissions. During this time, the machine consumed **0.02 kWh** of electricity from the grid and **0.49392 Wh** of gas input, resulting in equivalent emissions from burning.

2. Following this, at **08:36:25 UTC**, another heating process occurred on a steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[342], which had a mass of **0.02152 kg**. This operation also lasted for **900 seconds** and produced similar CO2 emissions of **0.0138019093344 kg**, with the same energy consumption metrics recorded as in the first process.

3. At **08:43:28 UTC**, a heating process was carried out on a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_372, weighing **0.02118 kg**. This heating operation again lasted for **900 seconds**, producing **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2 equivalent. The resource consumption mirrored previous processes, with **0.02 kWh** from the grid and **0.49392 Wh** of gas used.

4. The final heating activity occurred at **08:48:14 UTC** on a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_392, which had a mass of **0.02115 kg**. This operation also spanned **900 seconds** and emitted **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2. The energy inputs remained consistent, requiring **0.02 kWh** from the grid and **0.49392 Wh** from gas.

Later, at **08:53:27 UTC**, a splitting operation took place at the same workstation. This process utilized the machine identified as Machine[splitter01] to split a steel coil with ID SteelCoil[4] (mass **31.91076 kg**) and produced a new steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[418], weighing **0.02123 kg**. The splitting operation lasted **14.07 seconds**, resulting in **0.01471 kg** of CO2 equivalent emissions and generating a negligible steel waste of **0.00042 kg** designated for recycling. The electricity consumed during this operation was measured at **0.0214911 kWh**.

In summary, Workstation[o_workstation_1] facilitated multiple heating processes with consistent emissions and energy usage metrics, followed by a splitting operation that contributed to the production and recycling within the process ecosystem.
