On April 4, 2023, at 08:23:53 UTC, the workstation at Machine o_machine_splitter01 performed a task to split a steel sheet, resulting in the creation of a new steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[1774]. This steel sheet has a mass of 0.02126 kg and was produced from a steel coil with ID SteelCoil[3], which weighs 31.91076 kg. The splitting operation took approximately 15.15 seconds, during which it generated 0.01584 kg of CO2 emissions and consumed 0.0231412 kWh of electrical energy. Additionally, this process resulted in a negligible amount of steel waste, measuring approximately 0.00042 kg.
