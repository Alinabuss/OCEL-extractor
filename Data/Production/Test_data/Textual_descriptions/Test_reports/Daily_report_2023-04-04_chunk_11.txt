On April 4, 2023, a series of events involving the machine identified as Machine[former02], located at Workstation[1], took place.

At 12:29:53 UTC, Machine[former02] performed the activity of forming a steel sheet, utilizing SteelSheet[2737] with a mass of 0.02122 kg. This process resulted in the creation of a formed part, FormedPart[2737]. The operation took 5.0 seconds, produced 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 emissions, and consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electric energy drawn from the grid.

Shortly after, at 12:34:32 UTC, another formed part, o_formedpart_2756, was produced using the steel sheet o_steelsheet_2756, which had a mass of 0.0213 kg. This production process, also conducted at workstation o_workstation_1, lasted 5.0 seconds and emitted 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 equivalent. The operation was powered by Machine[former02], which contributed 0.0041667 kWh of electric energy from the grid. The formed part was generated as an output from the steel sheet input.

Later, at 12:59:10 UTC, Machine[former02] again performed a task involving a steel sheet with a mass of 0.02135 kg. This process lasted 5 seconds, resulted in the creation of a formed part, and produced 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 emissions, consuming 0.0041667 kWh of electric energy from the grid.

At 13:02:43 UTC, Machine[former02] was used to form another steel sheet, SteelSheet[2878], which had a mass of 0.02115 kg. This activity led to the formation of a new formed part, FormedPart[2878]. The operation took 5.0 seconds, emitted 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 equivalent, and consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electric energy sourced from the grid. 

Finally, at 13:10:57 UTC, Machine[former02] formed the steel sheet SteelSheet[2913], weighing 0.02109 kg. This operation produced the formed part FormedPart[2913] in a duration of 5 seconds. The process resulted in total CO2 emissions of 0.0028500228 kg and consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electrical energy from the grid.

Throughout the day, Machine[former02] consistently operated at Workstation[1], playing a vital role in the formation processes involving various steel sheets and producing corresponding formed parts.
