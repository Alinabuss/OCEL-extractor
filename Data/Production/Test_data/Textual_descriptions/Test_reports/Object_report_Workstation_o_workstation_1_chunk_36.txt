### Report for Object o_workstation_1

On April 5, 2023, a series of operations were conducted at workstation ID "o_workstation_1".

1. **Splitting Operation (08:12:06 UTC)**: A steel coil with ID "o_steelcoil_2" (31.91076 kg) was utilized by machine ID "o_machine_splitter01" to produce a steel sheet with ID "o_steelsheet_3204" (0.0212 kg). This operation lasted approximately 14.14 seconds and emitted 0.014785 kg of CO2. The machine also consumed 0.0216029 kWh of electricity and generated 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

2. **Heating Operation (08:12:34 UTC)**: A steel sheet with ID "SteelSheet[3202]" (0.02126 kg) was heated using machine ID "oven01". The heating process lasted for 900 seconds, resulting in CO2 equivalent emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg. Energy consumption included 0.02 kWh of electricity and 0.49392 Wh of gas.

3. **Heating Operation (08:19:58 UTC)**: Another steel sheet with ID "SteelSheet[3233]" (0.02136 kg) was heated at the same workstation and machine. This process similarly lasted for 900 seconds and generated approximately 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 emissions, requiring 0.02 kWh of electricity and 0.49392 Wh of gas.

4. **Splitting Operation (08:23:01 UTC)**: The machine known as "Splitter01" was used again to split a steel coil (31.91076 kg), resulting in a new steel sheet labeled "SteelSheet[3250]" (0.02122 kg). This operation took approximately 13.86 seconds, produced CO2 emissions of 0.01449 kg, and consumed 0.0211719 kWh of electricity, generating 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

5. **Splitting Operation (08:32:05 UTC)**: The process of splitting continued with the use of "Machine[splitter01]", involving a steel coil labeled "SteelCoil[2]". This led to the creation of a new steel sheet with ID "SteelSheet[3288]". The splitting duration was approximately 13.793 seconds, emitting 0.014422737 kg of CO2 and consuming 0.0210728 kWh of electricity, along with producing 0.00042 kg of steel waste earmarked for recycling.

All operations effectively utilized resources from the same workstation, demonstrating continuous processing of steel sheets throughout the specified period.
