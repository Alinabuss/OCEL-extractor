**Report for Object o_workstation_1**

On April 6, 2023, o_workstation_1 was actively involved in multiple significant operations, utilizing associated machines and materials throughout the day. 

1. At **10:59:02 UTC**, o_workstation_1 utilized **o_machine_splitter01** to split **o_steelsheet_5383**, which was derived from **o_steelcoil_1** weighing **31.91076 kg**. This operation lasted approximately **13.80 seconds**, producing a steel sheet with a mass of **0.02117 kg**. It resulted in **0.01443 kg** of CO2 emissions, generated **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling, and consumed **0.0210835 kWh** of electricity from the grid.

2. The next operation occurred at **11:11:42 UTC**, where **o_machine_splitter01** conducted another splitting operation involving **o_steelcoil_1**. This process produced **SteelSheet[o_steelsheet_5436]**, with a mass of **0.02118 kg**, taking around **14.39 seconds**. It emitted **0.0150477762 kg** of CO2 and created **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling, while consuming **0.0219866 kWh** from the grid.

3. At **11:15:16 UTC**, another split operation took place, albeit under the identification Workstation[1]. During this event, a steel coil with ID **SteelCoil[1]** (also weighing **31.91076 kg**) was used to produce **SteelSheet[5451]** with a mass of **0.0213 kg**. The process lasted approximately **13.92 seconds**, emitted **0.01455 kg** of CO2, created **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling, and utilized **0.0212621 kWh** of electricity.

4. Shortly thereafter, at **11:18:49 UTC**, **Machine[Splitter01]** processed the same **SteelCoil[1]**, leading to the creation of a new steel sheet **SteelSheet[5466]** weighing **0.02122 kg**. This operation had a duration of **14.26 seconds**, emitted **0.01491 kg** of CO2, generated **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling, and consumed **0.02178 kWh** of energy from the grid.

5. The final event recorded on the same day involved a heating process at **11:23:33 UTC**, using the steel sheet **o_steelsheet_5482**, which weighed **0.0212 kg**. Assigned to **o_workstation_1**, this operation utilized **o_machine_oven01** for a duration of **900 seconds**, consuming **0.02 kWh** of electricity and **0.49392 Wh** of gas. This heating resulted in approximately **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2 emissions.

Each event highlights the operational efficiency and environmental impact of the processes conducted at o_workstation_1, with consistent energy consumption and steel waste management practices across all activities.
