On April 5, 2023, several operations took place at Workstation[1] involving the machines identified as Machine[form_02] and Machine[former02], both of which were engaged in forming steel sheets into finished parts.

The first event occurred at 07:58:14 UTC, where a process named FormSteelSheet was initiated using Machine[form_02]. This operation took 5 seconds to complete, processing a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[2986], which had a weight of 0.0211 kg. During this time, the process generated 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 emissions and consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electricity from the grid. The output of this operation was the formed part labeled FormedPart[2986].

Shortly after, at 08:02:13 UTC, the machine Machine[former02] was utilized again at Workstation[1]. In this case, the input was a steel sheet labeled SteelSheet[3012], resulting in the output of FormedPart[3012]. This process also took 5 seconds, emitting 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 and utilizing 0.0041667 kWh of electricity.

Another operation was recorded at 08:09:40 UTC with the second machine, where a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[3081], weighing 0.02103 kg, was processed. The forming activity, which lasted 5 seconds, resulted in the formed part labeled FormedPart[3081]. Similar to the previous events, this operation generated 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 emissions and consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electricity.

The operations continued at 08:20:40 UTC with Machine[form_02] processing a steel sheet, SteelSheet[3166], producing a formed part labeled FormedPart[3166]. This task also took 5 seconds and resulted in emissions of 0.0028500228 kg of CO2, using 0.0041667 kWh of electricity from the grid.

Finally, at 08:38:09 UTC, the last recorded event of the day involved processing a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[3240] weighing 0.02115 kg. The machine used was Machine[former02], resulting in the creation of the formed part labeled FormedPart[3240]. This operation again took 5 seconds, emitted 0.0028500228 kg of CO2, and consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electricity.

In summary, on April 5, 2023, Workstation[1] saw a range of forming operations utilizing different steel sheets and machines, consistently producing formed parts while maintaining low emissions and energy consumption.
