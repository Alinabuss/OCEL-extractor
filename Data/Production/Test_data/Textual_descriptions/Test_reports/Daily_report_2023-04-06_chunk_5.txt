On April 6, 2023, several significant manufacturing processes were carried out, each contributing to the overall progression of operations at various workstations.

At 10:15:17 UTC, a steel sheet weighing 0.02112 kg was utilized in a forming operation to create a forged part. This task was conducted at a workstation using the machine identified as former02. The forming process lasted for 5 seconds, during which it produced an output forged part and resulted in a carbon dioxide equivalent emission of 0.0028500228 kg, with an electric consumption of 0.0041667 kWh from the grid.

Shortly afterward, at 10:16:50 UTC, a formed part with ID o_formedpart_5129 underwent a coating process at workstation o_workstation_1. This operation lasted for 300 seconds, generating carbon dioxide emissions of 0.1751156951 kg. The machine employed for this process was recognized as o_machine_coater03, and the operation consumed 0.25 kWh of electrical energy while utilizing approximately 0.0004 kg of coating material and producing a waste amount of 0.0001 kg of coating material.

Following this, at 10:17:01 UTC, a cutting operation commenced, creating a male part identified as MalePart[4707]. This process utilized a formed part with the ID FormedPart[4707] as input and was executed on Machine[cutter01] located at Workstation[2]. The cutting operation took about 9.96 seconds, during which it consumed 0.01522 kWh of energy and resulted in CO2 emissions totaling 0.0732 kg. Additionally, the operation consumed 0.073 cubic meters of compressed air and 0.061 cubic meters of nitrogen gas, with steel waste generation remaining unspecified.

At 10:17:36 UTC, another coating process took place involving a formed part with ID FormedPart[5135] at workstation Workstation[1]. The operation utilized the same machine, Machine[coater03], and lasted for 300 seconds, leading to a carbon dioxide emission of approximately 0.175 kg. The process consumed 0.25 kWh of electric energy, using 0.0004 kg of coating material while generating 0.0001 kg of coating material waste.

Finally, at 10:18:29 UTC, another steel sheet, this one weighing 0.02119 kg, was processed at the workstation identified as "o_workstation_1." This operation, performed using the machine "o_machine_former02," lasted for 5 seconds and resulted in a formed part of unspecified mass. The operation consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electric power from the grid and resulted in carbon dioxide equivalent emissions amounting to 0.0028500228 kg.

In summary, April 6, 2023, was marked by an integrated series of forming, coating, and cutting operations involving specific machines and workstations, contributing to the production of forged and formed parts with managed emissions and energy consumption.
