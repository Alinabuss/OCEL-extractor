On April 6, 2023, two significant operations involving the cutting of male parts were conducted at Workstation with ID "o_workstation_2," utilizing Machine with ID "o_machine_cutter01."

The first cutting operation commenced at 14:28:26 UTC and lasted approximately 10.0338 seconds. It involved the input formed part identified as "o_formedpart_5769," which was transformed into a male part identified as "o_malepart_5769." During this operation, 0.0153 kWh of electricity, 0.07 cubic meters of compressed air, and 0.061 cubic meters of nitrogen gas were consumed, while also releasing 0.061 cubic meters of nitrogen gas back into the environment. The carbon dioxide emissions for this operation amounted to 0.0739 kg. The quantity of steel waste generated during this process remains unspecified.

Shortly after, a second cutting process began at 14:29:11 UTC, with an approximate duration of 9.91 seconds. This operation produced the male part identified as MalePart[5552] from the formed part identified as FormedPart[5552]. The energy consumption for this operation was about 0.015 kWh, along with the use of 0.05 cubic meters of compressed air and 0.061 cubic meters of nitrogen gas, which was also emitted into the air. The associated carbon dioxide equivalent produced during this process was estimated at 0.064 kg. Like the previous operation, the specifics of steel waste production were not indicated.

Overall, both cutting operations were conducted efficiently at the same workstation, contributing to the production of male parts while incurring specific energy and emission metrics.
