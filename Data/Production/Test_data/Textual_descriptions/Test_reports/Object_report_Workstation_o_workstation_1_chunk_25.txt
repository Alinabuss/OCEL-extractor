### Report for Object o_workstation_1

On April 4, 2023, Workstation[1] was actively involved in a series of processes regarding steel sheet handling.

1. **Heating Operation**: On April 4, 2023, at 10:06:53 UTC, Workstation[1] utilized Machine[oven01] to heat a steel sheet labeled SteelSheet[2205]. The heating lasted for 900 seconds, resulting in carbon dioxide equivalent emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg, with an electric energy consumption of 0.02 kWh and a gas input of 0.49392 Wh.

2. **First Splitting Operation**: Following the heating, at 10:17:50 UTC on the same day, Workstation[1] performed a splitting operation using Machine[splitter01]. This action produced a new steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[2255], weighing 0.02113 kg, derived from SteelCoil[3] (mass: 31.91076 kg). The operation lasted approximately 13.68 seconds, consuming 0.0209 kWh of electric energy and emitting 0.0143 kg of CO2. Additionally, 0.00042 kg of steel waste was directed for recycling.

3. **Second Splitting Operation**: Just two minutes later, at 10:19:43 UTC, a subsequent splitting operation was executed at the same workstation, utilizing Machine[Splitter01]. This process generated another steel sheet, SteelSheet[2263], weighing 0.02114 kg, also created from SteelCoil[3]. The operation lasted around 14.55 seconds, leading to carbon emissions of 0.0152 kg and consuming 0.0222 kWh of electric power from the grid, along with producing 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

4. **Third Splitting Operation**: Shortly after, at 10:25:10 UTC, Workstation[1] conducted another splitting operation, which resulted in a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[2286], weighing 0.02106 kg. This operation, categorized as SplitSteelSheet, took approximately 14.96 seconds, consuming 0.0228591 kWh from the grid and emitting a carbon footprint of 0.0156445662 kg CO2e. Additionally, another 0.00042 kg of steel waste was produced from the processing of SteelCoil[3].

5. **Second Heating Operation**: Finally, at 10:30:23 UTC, a heating treatment was performed at Workstation[1] on a steel sheet identified as o_steelsheet_2304, using the machine o_machine_oven01. Similar to the first heating, this process lasted for 900 seconds, emitted 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent, and consumed 0.02 kWh of energy from the grid alongside 0.49392 Wh of gas input.

Throughout the series of operations, Workstation[1] remained integral to processing metal sheets while managing emissions and energy consumption effectively.
