**Report for Object o_workstation_1:**

On April 4, 2023, multiple operations were carried out at workstation o_workstation_1, all involving various steel sheets and coils.

1. At **08:31:46 UTC**, a heating process was conducted on a steel sheet with ID **o_steelsheet_1803**, weighing **0.02103 kg**. This operation, which lasted **900 seconds**, utilized machine **o_machine_oven01**. During this process, **0.02 kWh** of electric energy and **0.49392 Wh** of gas were consumed, resulting in a carbon dioxide equivalent emission of **0.0138019093344 kg**.

2. Shortly after, at **08:31:57 UTC**, another operation took place where a steel sheet was split using the machine **Splitter01** at the same workstation. This operation lasted approximately **14.43 seconds**, producing the steel sheet labeled **SteelSheet[1808]** weighing **0.02118 kg** from the steel coil **SteelCoil[3]**, which has a mass of **31.91076 kg**. The task consumed **0.022 kWh** of electricity and generated **0.00042 kg** of steel waste, with emissions of **0.015 kg** of CO2 equivalent.

3. Following that, at **08:33:52 UTC**, another splitting operation was initiated on a steel sheet identified as **SteelSheet[1816]**, weighing **0.02121 kg**. This task took approximately **14.53 seconds**, with a CO2 equivalent emission of **0.0152 kg**. The energy consumption from the grid for this operation was **0.0222057 kWh**, and it similarly produced **0.00042 kg** of steel waste, also designated for recycling.

4. Later, at **08:36:41 UTC**, another heating process commenced on a steel sheet marked **SteelSheet[1824]**, which weighed **0.02109 kg**. This operation utilized the machine **Machine[oven01]** for **900 seconds**, consuming **0.02 kWh** of electricity and **0.49392 Wh** of gas, resulting in the same carbon dioxide equivalent emission of **0.0138019093344 kg**.

5. Finally, at **08:37:40 UTC**, a splitting operation was performed on yet another steel sheet, identified as **SteelSheet[1832]**, weighing **0.02112 kg**. This task took approximately **14.666 seconds**, with a CO2 emission of **0.015335 kg** and generating **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling. The operation utilized machine **Splitter01** and drew **0.022407 kWh** of electricity from the grid, and this steel sheet was also derived from **SteelCoil[3]**.

These events illustrate the various processes involving heating and splitting operations performed at workstation o_workstation_1 on April 4, 2023, highlighting the relationships between the steel sheets and steel coils utilized in these operations.
