**Report on Operations at Workstation[1] Involving SteelCoil[2] on April 5, 2023**

On April 5, 2023, multiple operations occurred at Workstation[1] involving the steel coil identified as SteelCoil[2], utilizing the machine named Machine[splitter01]. 

1. **First Operation**: At 09:54:23 UTC, the splitting process began, producing a steel sheet labeled SteelSheet[3634] with a mass of 0.02115 kg. This operation took approximately 14.30 seconds, resulting in a CO2 emission of 0.01495 kg and consuming 0.0218472 kWh of electric energy. An insignificant steel waste of 0.00042 kg was marked for recycling.

2. **Second Operation**: Shortly after, at 10:00:05 UTC, another split operation was conducted on a steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[3658]. This process lasted for about 13.93 seconds, emitting 0.014566035 kg of CO2 and extracting 0.0212823 kWh of energy from the grid. Similar to the previous operation, this also resulted in a negligible steel waste of 0.00042 kg.

3. **Third Operation**: At 10:02:25 UTC, another splitting operation took place, yielding a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[3668] with a mass of 0.0212 kg. The operation lasted 14.35 seconds, resulting in a CO2 emission of 0.015 kg and energy consumption of approximately 0.0219 kWh. The steel waste generated was again noted at 0.00042 kg.

4. **Fourth Operation**: The next operation occurred at 10:14:19 UTC when Machine[splitter01] split a steel sheet from SteelCoil[2], resulting in a steel sheet of 0.02105 kg. This process lasted around 14.19 seconds and produced 0.01484 kg of CO2 equivalents, while consuming about 0.02168 kWh of electricity and generating 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

5. **Fifth Operation**: Lastly, at 10:14:48 UTC, another splitting operation took place, resulting in a steel sheet with a mass of 0.0213 kg. The splitting took approximately 14.0569 seconds, with emissions recorded at 0.014698389 kg of CO2 and energy consumed from the grid at 0.0214758 kWh. Again, 0.00042 kg of steel waste was marked for recycling.

Throughout these sequences, the consistent use of SteelCoil[2] and Machine[splitter01] at Workstation[1] demonstrates a well-coordinated operation with minimal steel waste output, maintaining a focus on energy consumption and environmental impact.
