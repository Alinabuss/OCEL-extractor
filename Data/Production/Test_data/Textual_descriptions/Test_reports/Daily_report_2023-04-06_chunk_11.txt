On April 6, 2023, a series of operations took place across various workstations, contributing to the production of several formed parts. 

At 11:33:58 UTC, a part with ID FormedPart[5457] was coated using Machine[coater03] at Workstation[1]. This coating operation, which lasted 300 seconds, generated approximately 0.175 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions and consumed 0.25 kWh of electric energy from the grid. The process utilized 0.0004 kg of coating material and produced 0.0001 kg of waste.

Shortly after, at 11:37:13 UTC, a female part with ID FemalePart[5082] was processed at Workstation[2] using Machine[cutter01]. This operation lasted approximately 12.66 seconds and resulted in the creation of an output part labeled as FormedPart[5082]. The operation recorded an energy consumption of 0.0193441 kWh and emitted 0.08556 kg of CO2. Additionally, it consumed 0.072 m続 of compressed air and 0.077 m続 of nitrogen gas, also emitted during this process, with steel waste totaling 0.00253 kg.

At 11:38:33 UTC, a cutting operation for a male part was conducted, lasting approximately 10.037 seconds. This operation also utilized Machine[cutter01] at Workstation[2], where FormedPart[5094] served as the input, resulting in the output of MalePart[5094]. During this operation, the machine consumed 0.0153349 kWh of electricity, resulting in 0.072 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions and utilizing 0.069 m続 of compressed air, along with 0.061 m続 of nitrogen gas.

Following this, at 11:38:36 UTC, another coating operation took place at Workstation[1] involving a formed part identified as FormedPart[5475]. This operation also lasted 300 seconds, with a carbon dioxide equivalent emission of 0.1751156951 kg, where 0.25 kWh of electricity was consumed from the grid, and 0.0004 kg of coating material was used, producing 0.0001 kg of waste.

Finally, at 11:38:58 UTC, a steel sheet weighing 0.0213 kg was processed in a forming operation using Machine[former02] at Workstation[1]. This operation, lasting 5 seconds, produced a formed part with unspecified mass, generating around 0.00285 kg of CO2 equivalent and consuming 0.0041667 kWh of energy.

Throughout these operations on April 6, 2023, relationships have been established amongst various parts, machines, and workstations, reflecting a continuous workflow aimed at the production and processing of formed parts.
