### Report for Object: Workstation[1]

On April 3, 2023, Workstation[1] executed several processing operations involving various steel components:

1. **Heating Process**: At 10:48:30 UTC, a heating process was conducted on SteelSheet[899] using Machine[oven01]. This operation lasted for 900 seconds and resulted in a CO2 equivalent emission of 0.0138019093344 kg. The energy consumed from the grid during this process was measured at 0.02 kWh, with a gas input amounting to 0.49392 Wh, corresponding to the same value for emissions from burning.

2. **First Splitting Operation**: Shortly after, at 10:50:10 UTC, a splitting process was performed on a steel coil, SteelCoil[4], using Machine[splitter01]. This operation lasted approximately 14.7 seconds and created an output sheet, SteelSheet[910], weighing 31.91076 kg. The CO2 equivalent emissions for this operation were 0.015368709 kg, and the electrical energy consumed was 0.0224558 kWh. Additionally, a steel waste for recycling, weighing 0.00042 kg, was produced.

3. **Second Splitting Operation**: At 10:52:59 UTC, Workstation[1] again processed SteelCoil[4] using Machine[splitter01], yielding SteelSheet[922] weighing 0.02101 kg. This SplitSteelSheet operation took approximately 14.87 seconds, consuming 0.02271 kWh of electricity and emitting 0.01554 kg of CO2 equivalent; it also produced 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

4. **Third Splitting Operation**: Another splitting process occurred at 10:53:13 UTC, where SteelCoil[4] was processed with Machine[splitter01], resulting in SteelSheet[923] weighing 0.02117 kg. The operation lasted around 14.7159 seconds, leading to 0.015387 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions and consuming 0.0224826 kWh of electrical energy. Like previous operations, this also generated 0.00042 kg of steel waste earmarked for recycling.

5. **Final Splitting Operation**: At 10:59:09 UTC, a subsequent operation took place on SteelCoil[4] using Machine[splitter01], producing SteelSheet[948] with a mass of 0.02102 kg. This operation lasted approximately 13.95 seconds, resulting in an emission of 0.0145868286 kg of CO2 equivalents and consuming 0.0213127 kWh of energy. It too resulted in the generation of 0.00042 kg of steel waste designated for recycling.

Throughout these operations, Workstation[1] effectively utilized its machines to transform steel coils into sheets while maintaining a focus on monitored energy consumption and waste management.
