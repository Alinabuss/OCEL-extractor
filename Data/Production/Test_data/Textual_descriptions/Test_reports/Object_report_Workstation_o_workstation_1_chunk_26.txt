**Report for Object o_workstation_1**

On April 4, 2023, a series of events occurred at Workstation o_workstation_1 involving several processes related to steel sheets and coils.

1. **Split Steel Sheet Process**: At 10:37:00 UTC, a split operation involving machine identified as splitter01 took place. A steel coil with ID SteelCoil[3], weighing 31.91076 kg, was processed to produce a steel sheet weighing 0.02126 kg. This operation lasted approximately 13.911 seconds and generated CO2 emissions of 0.014546 kg, alongside 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling. The energy consumption from the grid was recorded at about 0.02143 kWh.

2. **Another Steel Sheet Splitting**: Just after, at 10:37:56 UTC, a second steel sheet was split using the same splitter machine. This split resulted in the creation of a steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[2340], produced from SteelCoil[3]. This process took approximately 14.03 seconds, emitting around 0.01467 kg of CO2, and again incurred an estimated energy consumption of 0.02143 kWh along with 0.00042 kg of steel waste.

3. **Heating of Steel Sheet o_steelsheet_2342**: A subsequent heating process took place at 10:39:21 UTC for a steel sheet identified as o_steelsheet_2342, weighing 0.0213 kg. This heating process employed machine o_machine_oven01 and lasted 900 seconds. It resulted in CO2 emissions of approximately 0.0138019093344 kg, with an electricity consumption of about 0.02 kWh from the grid and gas inputs of 0.49392 Wh, which also produced the same amount in burn emissions.

4. **Heating of Steel Sheet o_steelsheet_2352**: Following the previous heating, another steel sheet, ID o_steelsheet_2352, weighing 0.02129 kg, was heated at 10:41:47 UTC at the same workstation and machine (o_machine_oven01). This process mirror the previous, lasting 900 seconds, and producing CO2 emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg, with 0.02 kWh of electricity and gas inputs of 0.49392 Wh.

5. **Final Splitting Event**: Lastly, at 10:46:16 UTC, a final split operation occurred at Workstation o_workstation_1, utilizing machine splitter01 to process SteelCoil[3] again. This operation lasted 15.085 seconds, producing a steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[2375], weighing 0.02102 kg, while emitting 0.01577 kg of CO2 and consuming approximately 0.023 kWh from the grid. The minimal steel waste from this process was measured at 0.00042 kg, also designated for recycling.

Throughout these events, the interconnectedness of the workstation, two machines (splitter01 and o_machine_oven01), steel sheets, and steel coils is evidenced in the operations conducted to produce and process the steel materials.
