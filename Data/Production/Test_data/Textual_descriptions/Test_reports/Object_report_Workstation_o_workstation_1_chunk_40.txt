**Event Report for Object o_workstation_1**

On April 5, 2023, several significant operations occurred at the workstation identified as o_workstation_1:

1. At **09:36:18 UTC**, the machine *oven01* processed a steel sheet with ID *o_steelsheet_3554*. The heating lasted for **900 seconds**, producing approximately **0.0138 kg** of CO2 equivalent emissions. The operation consumed **0.02 kWh** of electricity, utilized **0.49392 Wh** of gas input, and resulted in emissions equivalent to the gas input.

2. Shortly after, at **09:36:58 UTC**, another heating operation was conducted on a steel sheet identified as *SteelSheet[3557]*, with a mass of **0.02138 kg**. This process, also carried out using *oven01*, lasted for **900 seconds**. It consumed **0.02 kWh** of electricity and **0.49392 Wh** of gas, emitting approximately **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2 equivalent.

3. At **09:40:47 UTC**, a splitting process was executed involving a steel coil (*o_steelcoil_2*) and the machine *o_machine_splitter01*, both located at o_workstation_1. The process lasted about **13.91 seconds**, resulting in CO2 emissions of **0.01454 kg** and generating **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling. The output of this operation was a steel sheet with ID *o_steelsheet_3577*, weighing **0.0212 kg**.

4. At **09:49:52 UTC**, yet another steel sheet was split using *Splitter01*, also located at Workstation 1. This operation took approximately **13.79 seconds** and produced a steel sheet weighing **0.02105 kg**. During this split, it generated **0.01442 kg** of CO2 emissions and consumed **0.02106 kWh** of electricity. It involved a steel coil weighing **31.91076 kg**, and the process prepared **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling.

5. Finally, at **09:52:28 UTC**, a heating process was initiated for a steel sheet with ID *SteelSheet[3622]* at Workstation[1]. This operation, conducted using *oven01*, lasted **900 seconds** and recorded an energy consumption of **0.02 kWh** from the electric grid, a gas input of **0.49392 Wh**, and CO2 emissions of approximately **0.0138019093344 kg**. The steel sheet involved in this process had a mass of **0.02125 kg**.

Throughout all these events, the operations consistently utilized the resources and machines present at o_workstation_1, highlighting the interrelated processes involved in processing steel materials.
