### Report on Object o_steelcoil_2

On April 5, 2023, object o_steelcoil_2 was involved in multiple events related to the production of steel sheets.

1. **Event 1**: At 09:40:47 UTC, a splitting process occurred at workstation ID o_workstation_1 using machine ID o_machine_splitter01. The steel coil o_steelcoil_2 was processed, resulting in the creation of steel sheet ID o_steelsheet_3577 with a mass of 0.0212 kg. This operation lasted approximately 13.91 seconds, emitting 0.01454 kg of CO2 equivalents and producing 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

2. **Event 2**: Shortly after, at 09:49:52 UTC, the same machine, identified as Splitter01 located at Workstation 1, split another steel sheet from the same steel coil, which weighed 31.91076 kg. The resulting steel sheet weighed 0.02105 kg. The process lasted about 13.79 seconds, releasing 0.01442 kg of CO2 and consuming 0.02106 kWh of electrical energy, while generating 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

3. **Event 3**: At 09:54:23 UTC, another operation at Workstation[1] used machine Machine[splitter01] to split a steel sheet from the same coil, which continued to weigh 31.91076 kg. The output was steel sheet SteelSheet[3634], weighing 0.02115 kg. This operation took around 14.30 seconds, yielding 0.01495 kg of CO2 emissions and consuming 0.0218472 kWh of energy. A minimal steel waste of 0.00042 kg was also marked for recycling.

4. **Event 4**: At 10:00:05 UTC, machine Splitter01 was again employed to split a sheet (ID SteelSheet[3658]) using steel coil SteelCoil[2]. The operation lasted roughly 13.93 seconds, emitting 0.014566035 kg of CO2. It required 0.0212823 kWh of electrical energy and generated a negligible steel waste of 0.00042 kg for recycling.

5. **Event 5**: Finally, at 10:02:25 UTC, another process for splitting a steel sheet was conducted at Workstation[1]. Machine[splitter01] split a sheet from SteelCoil[2], producing steel sheet SteelSheet[3668] with a resulting mass of 0.0212 kg. This operation lasted approximately 14.35 seconds, emitting 0.015 kg of CO2 and consuming 0.0219 kWh of electricity, while again generating a minimal waste of 0.00042 kg for recycling.

Throughout these operations, o_steelcoil_2 was consistently utilized as the raw material, demonstrating its role in the production chain within the specified timestamps.
