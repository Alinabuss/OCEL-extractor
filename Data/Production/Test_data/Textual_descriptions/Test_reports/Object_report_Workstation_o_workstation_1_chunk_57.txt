### Report on Heating Processes at Workstation o_workstation_1

On April 6, 2023, a series of heating processes took place at workstation ID o_workstation_1, utilizing machine ID o_machine_oven01 to heat various steel sheets. The details of each event are as follows:

1. At **10:10:46 UTC**, a heating operation was conducted on a steel sheet with ID **o_steelsheet_5175**, which has a mass of **0.02116 kg**. The process lasted for **900 seconds**, consuming **0.02 kWh** of electricity and **0.49392 Wh** of gas. The operation resulted in carbon dioxide emissions of approximately **0.0138019093344 kg** and an emission of burn measured at **0.49392 Wh**.

2. Following this, at **10:18:16 UTC**, another steel sheet, ID **o_steelsheet_5207**, weighing **0.02107 kg**, underwent heating for the same duration of **900 seconds**. This process also recorded **0.02 kWh** of electricity consumption and **0.49392 Wh** of gas input, leading to equal emissions of **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2 equivalent and **0.49392 Wh** from burning.

3. At **10:20:37 UTC**, a heating process was executed for a steel sheet with ID **SteelSheet[5217]**, having a mass of **0.02119 kg**, which lasted for **900 seconds**. It resulted in carbon dioxide emissions of **0.0138019093344 kg**, with a consumption of **0.02 kWh** of electricity and **0.49392 Wh** of gas input. The emission from burning was also recorded at **0.49392 Wh**.

4. Shortly after, at **10:20:55 UTC**, workstation ID o_workstation_1 facilitated the heating of another steel sheet, ID **steelsheet_5218**, with a mass of **0.02133 kg** for **900 seconds**. The operation similarly yielded **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2 equivalent emissions, and recorded the same energy consumption and emissions: **0.02 kWh** of electricity, **0.49392 Wh** of gas input, and **0.49392 Wh** from burn emissions.

5. Finally, at **10:22:17 UTC**, the heating of a steel sheet identified as **o_steelsheet_5224**, weighing **0.02095 kg**, was initiated. This process again spanned **900 seconds**, with energy metrics matching the previous events: **0.02 kWh** electricity consumption, **0.49392 Wh** gas input, and resulting emissions of **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2 and **0.49392 Wh** from burning.

This series of heating processes highlights the consistent operational details and environmental impacts associated with the use of workstation o_workstation_1.
