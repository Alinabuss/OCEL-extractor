On April 6, 2023, multiple operations occurred, starting with a forming process at 13:09:02 UTC. During this event, a steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[5858] weighing 0.02118 kg was utilized as input in the process. The operation took place on a machine identified as Machine[former02] at Workstation[1]. The machine consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electricity, and the forming process lasted for 5 seconds, resulting in the creation of a formed part with ID FormedPart[5858]. This operation emitted 0.0028500228 kg of CO2e.

Shortly after, at 13:10:08 UTC, a coating operation was performed on a different formed part, identified by ID o_formedpart_5862. This operation was carried out using a machine labeled o_machine_coater03 at Workstation o_workstation_1. The coating process lasted for 300 seconds, during which it generated 0.1751156951 kg of CO2 emissions, consumed 0.25 kWh of electricity, and utilized 0.0004 kg of coating material, resulting in 0.0001 kg of coating material waste.

At 13:13:11 UTC, another coating event took place, this time involving a formed part identified as FormedPart[5874], which was coated using Machine[coater03] at Workstation[1]. This operation also lasted for 300 seconds, accrued 0.1751156951 kg of CO2 emissions, consumed 0.25 kWh of electricity, and used 0.0004 kg of coating material, generating 0.0001 kg of coating material waste.

Later, at 13:27:28 UTC, a cutting process was conducted to create a female part with ID FemalePart[5502] from the formed part with ID FormedPart[5502]. This operation was executed on Machine[cutter01] at Workstation[2] and lasted approximately 12.52 seconds. It consumed 0.0191324 kWh of electricity and utilized 0.074 m続 of compressed air and 0.077 m続 of nitrogen gas, which was both used and emitted into the air. The cutting process produced a steel waste amounting to 0.00254 kg and emitted 0.085 kg of CO2 equivalent.

Finally, at 13:28:35 UTC, the same machine, cutter01, was used at Workstation[2] to cut a female part generated from another formed part with ID 5575. This cutting process lasted around 12.47 seconds, consuming 0.019053 kWh of electricity from the grid, 0.083 m続 of compressed air, and 0.076 m続 of nitrogen gas, which was both used and emitted. The operation resulted in 0.00254 kg of steel waste and generated 0.0878675942222 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions. The specific masses of the female part with ID 5575 and the corresponding formed part were not detailed. 

Overall, April 6, 2023, was a day marked by several interlinked manufacturing processes involving significant resource consumption and various emissions.
