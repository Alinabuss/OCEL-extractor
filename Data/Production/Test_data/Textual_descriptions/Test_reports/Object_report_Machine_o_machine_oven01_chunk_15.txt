**Report on Heating Operations Involving o_machine_oven01**

On April 5, 2023, multiple heating operations were conducted using the machine o_machine_oven01 at workstation o_workstation_1, involving various steel sheets with unique IDs.

1. The first operation involved a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_3039, weighing 0.02134 kg. The heating began at 07:48:22 UTC and lasted for 900 seconds, during which 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent was emitted. Energy consumption included 0.02 kWh from the grid and 0.49392 Wh of gas input, resulting in equivalent emissions from the combustion process.

2. Shortly after, at 07:48:36 UTC, a second heating operation took place using a steel sheet ID o_steelsheet_3041, weighing 0.02114 kg. This heating process also lasted for 900 seconds, generating emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent. The energy consumption mirrored the first operation, with 0.02 kWh from the grid and a gas input of 0.49392 Wh, producing the same emissions from burning.

3. At 08:00:32 UTC, a third steel sheet, identified as o_steelsheet_3149, underwent heating for 900 seconds, with emissions recorded at 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent. The operation involved the same energy inputs: 0.02 kWh from the grid and 0.49392 Wh of gas input, alongside equal emissions from combustion.

4. A fourth event occurred at 08:09:57 UTC, where a steel sheet labeled SteelSheet[3191], weighing 0.02129 kg, was heated for 900 seconds. Emissions totaled 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent, with energy usage identical to previous operations â€” 0.02 kWh from the grid and gas input at 0.49392 Wh leading to equivalent emissions.

5. Finally, at 08:12:34 UTC, the last operation involved a steel sheet ID SteelSheet[3202], weighing 0.02126 kg. This heating event also lasted for 900 seconds and produced 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions. As with the other operations, it consumed 0.02 kWh of electricity and 0.49392 Wh of gas, resulting in equivalent emissions from combustion.

All operations effectively utilized the equipment and materials at workstation o_workstation_1, maintaining consistent energy consumption and emission levels across all heating processes.
