### Report on Object: o_machine_splitter01

On April 6, 2023, the machine identified as **o_machine_splitter01** operated at **workstation o_workstation_1** for multiple transactions involving the splitting of steel sheets.

1. **First Operation**: At **10:33:26 UTC**, the machine performed a split on a steel sheet weighing **0.02108 kg**, derived from a steel coil labeled **31.91076 kg**. This operation lasted approximately **14.36 seconds**, generating **0.015016107 kg** of CO2 emissions, consuming **0.0219403 kWh** of electricity, and producing **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling.

2. **Second Operation**: Shortly after, at **10:45:16 UTC**, the machine executed another split, resulting in a new steel sheet with ID **steelsheet_5325**, created from the same steel coil **steelcoil_1**. This activity took approximately **13.9 seconds**, produced **0.01454 kg** of CO2 emissions, consumed **0.02124 kWh** of electricity, and also generated **0.00042 kg** of steel waste.

3. **Third Operation**: At **10:55:28 UTC**, during the process termed **SplitSteelSheet**, the machine processed a steel sheet, resulting in a product with ID **SteelSheet[5368]** from **SteelCoil[1]** weighing **31.91076 kg**. This operation lasted **14.43 seconds**, produced **0.0151 kg** of CO2 emissions, consumed around **0.022 kWh** of electricity, and created **0.00042 kg** of steel waste.

4. **Fourth Operation**: Following this, at **10:56:40 UTC**, the machine split a steel sheet, resulting in the output **SteelSheet[5373]**, again from **SteelCoil[1]**. The duration was approximately **14.2 seconds**, generating **0.014851 kg** of CO2 emissions, consuming **0.0216987 kWh** of electricity, and producing **0.00042 kg** of steel waste.

5. **Fifth Operation**: Finally, at **10:57:37 UTC**, the machine split a steel sheet identified as **o_steelsheet_5377**, also derived from **o_steelcoil_1**. This process lasted around **14.19 seconds**, resulting in a weight of **0.02096 kg** for the new steel sheet, generating **0.01484 kg** of CO2 emissions, consuming **0.0216812 kWh** of electricity, and leading to **0.00042 kg** of steel waste earmarked for recycling.

Overall, throughout these operations on April 6, 2023, the machine exhibited consistent performance in steel sheet splitting, while maintaining steady emissions and resource consumption metrics.
