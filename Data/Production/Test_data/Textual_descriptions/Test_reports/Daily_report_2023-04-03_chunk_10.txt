On April 3, 2023, several significant processes occurred, each contributing to the overall operations involving steel parts at different workstations and machines.

At 10:43:40 UTC, an execution of the steel sheet forming process took place at workstation 1, utilizing machine "Machine_former02." This process took 5.0 seconds and emitted 0.0028500228 kg of CO2. The input for this operation was a steel sheet with a mass of 0.02115 kg, and it successfully produced a formed part. Additionally, the process consumed 0.0041667 kWh of energy from the grid.

Shortly after, at 10:44:27 UTC, another forming operation occurred at the same workstation involving machine "machine_former02." During this 5-second process, a steel sheet weighing 0.021 kg was utilized as input, again yielding a formed part and emitting the same 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 while consuming 0.0041667 kWh of electricity from the grid.

At 10:49:55 UTC, a male part was cut at workstation 2 using machine "Machine[cutter01]." This operation lasted approximately 10.02 seconds, resulting in a male part with ID MalePart[563] as output, sourced from a formed part identified by ID FormedPart[563]. The process had total emissions of approximately 0.0686 kg of CO2 and consumed 0.0153 kWh of energy, along with utilizing 0.064 cubic meters of compressed air and 0.061 cubic meters of nitrogen gas.

Following this, at 10:51:28 UTC, a coating operation was executed on the formed part with ID o_formedpart_841 at workstation o_workstation_1, employing machine o_machine_coater03. The operation spanned 300 seconds and generated 0.1751156951 kg of CO2 emissions, consuming 0.25 kWh of electricity from the grid. During this process, 0.0004 kg of coating material was used, along with 0.0001 kg of coating material waste produced.

Finally, at 10:54:00 UTC, another coating operation was conducted on a formed part identified as o_formedpart_853 at workstation o_workstation_1, again using machine o_machine_coater03. This activity mirrored the previous coating operation, lasting 300 seconds and resulting in identical emissions of 0.1751156951 kg of CO2, alongside a consumption of 0.25 kWh of electricity, 0.0004 kg of coating material, and 0.0001 kg of coating material waste.

Overall, all operations carried out on April 3, 2023, demonstrate an interconnected workflow involving forming, cutting, and coating processes, emphasizing the relationship between the objects processed and the machines used at their respective workstations.
