**Summary Report for Object: o_machine_oven01**

On April 4, 2023, machine o_machine_oven01 was utilized multiple times at workstation o_workstation_1 to heat various steel sheets. 

1. The first heating process occurred at 11:10:27 UTC for steel sheet ID o_steelsheet_2473, weighing 0.02118 kg. This operation lasted 900 seconds, resulting in a CO2 equivalent emission of 0.0138019093344 kg. Energy consumption was recorded at 0.02 kWh from the grid, with a gas input of 0.49392 Wh, and an equivalent emission due to burn of 0.49392 Wh.

2. At 11:14:15 UTC, a similar process was initiated for steel sheet ID o_steelsheet_2489, which had a weight of 0.02132 kg. This heating also lasted 900 seconds, generating the same emissions and energy consumption as the previous process.

3. Just 26 seconds later, at 11:14:41 UTC, machine o_machine_oven01 performed another heating operation for steel sheet ID o_steelsheet_2491, weighing 0.02114 kg. The process again lasted 900 seconds and mirrored the emissions and energy attributes of the earlier activities.

4. A fourth heating process for steel sheet ID SteelSheet[2521] was executed at 11:21:51 UTC, with a weight of 0.0211 kg. This operation, lasting for 900 seconds, resulted in identical emissions and energy consumption as the preceding processes.

5. Finally, at 11:23:46 UTC, the last heating event involved steel sheet ID o_steelsheet_2529, maintaining the same duration, emissions, and energy consumption metrics.

In summary, across these five heating processes, each lasting 900 seconds, machine o_machine_oven01 consistently produced CO2 emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg and consumed 0.02 kWh of electricity and 0.49392 Wh of gas input, while each process was conducted at workstation o_workstation_1.
