**Summary Report for o_machine_splitter01**

On April 5, 2023, the machine identified as o_machine_splitter01, located at Workstation[1], performed several splitting operations on steel coils, resulting in the creation of new steel sheets throughout the day.

1. **Event at 12:03:33 UTC**: The splitting process involved SteelCoil[2], which weighed 31.91076 kg, to produce SteelSheet[4179] with a mass of 0.02123 kg. This operation lasted approximately 14.41 seconds, resulting in a CO2 equivalent emission of 0.01507 kg and electricity consumption of 0.02201 kWh. A minimal steel waste of 0.00042 kg was also generated for recycling.

2. **Event at 12:09:14 UTC**: The machine again utilized SteelCoil[2] to generate SteelSheet[4203], which had a mass of 0.02103 kg. The splitting process lasted 14.1422 seconds, producing 0.014788 kg of CO2 emissions and consuming approximately 0.0216062 kWh of electricity, along with 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

3. **Event at 12:25:24 UTC**: Another splitting operation occurred, producing SteelSheet[o_steelsheet_4271] from SteelCoil[o_steelcoil_2], which also weighed 31.91076 kg. This event lasted about 14.54 seconds and resulted in emissions totaling 0.0152 kg of CO2 and an electric consumption of approximately 0.0222 kWh. A similar amount of steel waste, around 0.00042 kg, was designated for recycling.

4. **Event at 12:40:54 UTC**: The machine performed yet another splitting operation on SteelCoil[o_steelcoil_2], yielding SteelSheet[o_steelsheet_4336]. This activity lasted about 13.67 seconds, with 0.0143 kg of CO2 equivalent produced, around 0.0209 kWh of electricity consumed, and 0.00042 kg of steel waste generated for recycling.

5. **Event at 12:59:54 UTC**: The final operation of the day also involved SteelCoil[2] to produce SteelSheet[4416] weighing 0.02132 kg. This process lasted 14.01 seconds, with CO2 emissions of 0.01465 kg and electricity consumption recorded at approximately 0.02141 kWh, alongside 0.00042 kg of steel waste designated for recycling.

Throughout the day on April 5, 2023, the machine o_machine_splitter01 effectively processed SteelCoil[2] and SteelCoil[o_steelcoil_2], consistently producing various steel sheets while maintaining a low level of emissions and waste production.
