**Report for Object o_steelcoil_1**

On April 6, 2023, the steel coil identified as SteelCoil[1], which has a mass of 31.91076 kg, was involved in multiple splitting operations at Workstation[1], utilizing the machine named Machine[Splitter01].

1. **Event 1:** At 10:00:03 UTC, the splitting process commenced, producing a steel sheet labeled SteelSheet[5134] with a mass of 0.02122 kg. This operation lasted approximately 15.02 seconds, generated 0.0157 kg of CO2 emissions, and consumed about 0.0229427 kWh of electricity. A minimal amount of steel waste measured at 0.00042 kg was designated for recycling.

2. **Event 2:** At 10:00:59 UTC, another splitting operation yielded a steel sheet identified as o_steelsheet_5138, weighing 0.02115 kg. The activity lasted approximately 14.57 seconds and involved an energy consumption of 0.0222667 kWh. This process resulted in 0.0152393646 kg of CO2 emissions and produced 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

3. **Event 3:** At 10:07:53 UTC, a third operation resulted in the production of a steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[5167], weighing 0.02116 kg. The duration of this splitting process was about 14.72 seconds, producing 0.01539 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions and consuming around 0.02249 kWh of electricity. Similar to previous events, it also generated 0.00042 kg of steel waste intended for recycling.

4. **Event 4:** The splitting activity continued at 10:25:52 UTC, yielding another steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[5243] and a mass of 0.02139 kg. This operation took approximately 13.607 seconds, resulted in 0.014229 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions, and consumed about 0.0207889 kWh of electricity. The operation again produced 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

5. **Event 5:** Finally, at 10:29:10 UTC, the last splitting operation of the day produced a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[5257], weighing 0.02106 kg. This process lasted approximately 13.99 seconds, emitting 0.01463 kg of CO2 and consuming 0.02138 kWh from the grid, while again yielding 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

Throughout all these operations, the steel coil SteelCoil[1] served as the primary input, consistently generating minimal waste targeted for recycling with each split.
