**Report on Events Involving o_machine_splitter01**

**Event Summary:**

On April 4, 2023, at 11:50:04 UTC, the machine o_machine_splitter01, located at workstation o_workstation_1, began a splitting process involving a SteelCoil with ID o_steelcoil_3, which has a mass of 31.91076 kg. This operation resulted in the creation of a SteelSheet with ID o_steelsheet_2643, weighing 0.02098 kg. The process lasted approximately 14.5 seconds, generating 0.0152 kg of CO2 emissions and producing 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

Shortly after, at 11:50:18 UTC, the same machine executed another splitting operation, producing a SteelSheet with ID SteelSheet[2644] weighing 0.02109 kg from SteelCoil[3]. This procedure lasted approximately 13.8 seconds, consuming 0.02108 kWh of electricity and emitting 0.01443 kg of CO2, while also creating 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

A third operation took place at 11:52:55 UTC, where o_machine_splitter01 split the SteelCoil[3] again, resulting in a SteelSheet with ID o_steelsheet_2655, which weighed 0.02113 kg. This operation took approximately 14.14 seconds and generated 0.0147834786 kg of CO2 emissions, while consuming 0.0216002 kWh of electricity and producing 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

Later, at 11:56:58 UTC, the machine performed another split at the same workstation, producing a SteelSheet with ID o_steelsheet_2672, weighing 0.02125 kg, once again from o_steelcoil_3. This action lasted around 14.30 seconds, resulting in 0.01495 kg of CO2 emissions, consuming 0.02184 kWh of electricity, and generating 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

Finally, at 12:03:09 UTC, the o_machine_splitter01 executed a further split resulting in SteelSheet[2698], with a mass of 0.02125 kg, also derived from SteelCoil[3]. This operation lasted approximately 14.29 seconds, consuming 0.0218355 kWh of electricity, producing 0.0149444238 kg of CO2 emissions, and generating 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.
