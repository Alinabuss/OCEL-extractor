On April 4, 2023, several operations were recorded involving Machine[splitter01] at Workstation[1], primarily utilizing SteelCoil[3] with a mass of 31.91076 kg to produce various steel sheets.

1. **First Operation**: At 10:37:00 UTC, a steel sheet splitting process commenced, lasting approximately 13.911 seconds. It produced a steel sheet weighing 0.02126 kg and emitted 0.014546 kg of CO2. Energy consumption from the grid was measured at 0.02143 kWh, with 0.00042 kg of steel waste generated for recycling.

2. **Second Operation**: At 10:37:56 UTC, another operation took place on SteelCoil[3], resulting in a steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[2340]. This process took about 14.03 seconds, producing emissions of 0.01467 kg of CO2. The energy consumption was around 0.02143 kWh, and it generated 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

3. **Third Operation**: At 10:46:16 UTC, a split operation was performed on a steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[2375], completing in 15.085 seconds. It emitted 0.01577 kg of CO2 and consumed approximately 0.023 kWh of electrical energy. This operation also resulted in 0.00042 kg of steel waste, designated for recycling.

4. **Fourth Operation**: At 11:10:42 UTC, another splitting operation generated a steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[2478], weighing 0.02116 kg. This process took around 14.664 seconds, emitted 0.015333 kg of CO2, and used approximately 0.0224042 kWh of energy. Similar to previous operations, it produced 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

5. **Fifth Operation**: Finally, at 11:12:07 UTC, another task was conducted involving the same SteelCoil[3], resulting in SteelSheet[2484] with a mass of 0.02125 kg. This operation took approximately 14.239 seconds, generated 0.014888 kg of CO2, and consumed about 0.0217542 kWh of energy, with 0.00042 kg of steel waste designated for recycling.

Throughout these events, SteelCoil[3] was the primary raw material used to produce the steel sheets, and the operations consistently produced negligible amounts of steel waste while contributing to CO2 emissions corresponding to each processing task.
