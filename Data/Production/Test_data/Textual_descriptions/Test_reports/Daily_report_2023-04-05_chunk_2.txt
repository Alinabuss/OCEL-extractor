On April 5, 2023, several significant operations were conducted involving various machines and parts.

At 08:45:37 UTC, a female part with ID FemalePart[2988] was successfully processed using Machine[cutter01] at Workstation[2]. This operation, which lasted approximately 12.57 seconds, effectively transformed the female part into a formed part with ID FormedPart[2988]. During this process, the machine consumed 0.0192 kWh from the grid, utilized 0.093 cubic meters of compressed air, and involved 0.077 cubic meters of nitrogen gas. It also emitted 0.077 cubic meters of nitrogen into the air, generated 0.00251 kg of steel waste, and contributed to a carbon dioxide equivalent of 0.09234 kg.

Shortly after, at 08:55:45 UTC, a machine identified as "o_machine_cutter01" was utilized to cut a female part recognized as "o_femalepart_2902." This procedure occurred at Workstation[2] and used an input formed part labeled "o_formedpart_2902." The cutting process took approximately 12.61 seconds, producing the female part "o_femalepart_2902" while generating 0.00253 kg of steel waste. The machine consumed 0.019263 kWh of electricity, used 0.071 m続 of compressed air, and operated with 0.077 m続 of nitrogen gas, both of which were emitted to the environment. The carbon dioxide equivalent released during this operation was 0.083197 kg.

Following this, at 08:56:25 UTC, Machine[formers02] was engaged at Workstation[1] to form a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[3317], which weighed 0.02118 kg. This operation lasted for 5 seconds, producing a formed part identified as FormedPart[3317]. The steel sheet served as input, while the formed part was the output. This process emitted 0.002850 kg of CO2 equivalent and consumed 0.004167 kWh of electricity from the grid.

Later, at 09:01:44 UTC, Machine Cutter01 was again employed for cutting, this time of a Female Part with ID o_femalepart_2939. This operation turned the female part into a Formed Part with ID o_formedpart_2939. The cutting process lasted around 12.5 seconds, with a CO2 emission of 0.0851 kg. The operation consumed 0.0191 kWh of electric energy, utilized 0.076 cubic meters of compressed air, and involved 0.076 cubic meters of nitrogen gas, while producing 0.00255 kg of steel waste at Workstation[2].

Finally, at 09:15:36 UTC, the machine identified as machine_cutter01 at Workstation[2] cut a female part with ID femalepart_3197, resulting in a new part identified as formedpart_3197. This process took approximately 12.45 seconds, resulting in a CO2 equivalent emission of 0.09434 kg. The operation consumed 0.01902 kWh of electricity, utilized 0.098 m続 of compressed air, and involved 0.076 m続 of nitrogen gas, which was also emitted into the air in the same volume, alongside generating 0.00253 kg of steel waste. 

In summary, April 5, 2023, was characterized by multiple operations involving various female parts being processed, cut, and formed into new components across designated workstations, all while monitoring energy consumption, waste generation, and emissions.
