**Report for Object o_workstation_1**

On April 6, 2023, multiple processes were conducted at Workstation[1], involving the heating and processing of several steel sheets using machines located at the workstation.

1. **Heating Process 1**: At 09:07:53 UTC, the heating process for a steel sheet, ID SteelSheet[4910], commenced. This process lasted 900 seconds and emitted approximately 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent. The operation utilized Machine[oven01], consuming 0.02 kWh of electric energy, and had an input of 0.49392 Wh of gas, with equivalent emissions from burning.

2. **Heating Process 2**: Following shortly, at 09:10:33 UTC, a similar heating process was executed for a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_4921. This operation also lasted 900 seconds, utilized machine o_machine_oven01, and produced the same CO2 emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg. Energy consumption from the grid was recorded at 0.02 kWh, with gas input and emissions from burning both at 0.49392 Wh. The weight of this steel sheet was 0.02109 kg.

3. **Heating Process 3**: At 09:15:01 UTC, another heat treatment was carried out for a steel sheet, ID SteelSheet[4940], weighing 0.0212 kg. This operation took 900 seconds at Workstation[1] using machine Oven[001]. The heating consumed 0.02 kWh of electrical energy, with gas input at 0.49392 Wh. The resulting CO2 equivalent emissions were approximately 0.0138 kg.

4. **Splitting Process**: At 09:18:35 UTC, a splitting operation was carried out using Machine[splitter01], designated as the SplitSteelSheet process. This event lasted approximately 14.63 seconds and produced an output steel sheet, ID SteelSheet[4959], with a mass of 0.02106 kg from an input steel coil, ID SteelCoil[1], weighing 31.91076 kg. Energy consumption during this process was recorded at 0.0223526 kWh, with carbon emissions measured at 0.0152981202 kg CO2e, and 0.00042 kg of steel waste generated for recycling.

5. **Heating Process 4**: At 09:21:42 UTC, the heating of steel sheet ID o_steelsheet_4968, weighing 0.02116 kg, took place at the same workstation using machine o_machine_oven01. This operation, lasting 900 seconds, mirrored previous heating processes with emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent. The machine consumed 0.02 kWh of electric energy, along with gas input and combustion emissions both at 0.49392 Wh.

In summary, on April 6, 2023, Workstation[1] efficiently processed multiple steel sheets, involving heating and splitting operations, while maintaining consistent energy and emission metrics throughout these activities.
