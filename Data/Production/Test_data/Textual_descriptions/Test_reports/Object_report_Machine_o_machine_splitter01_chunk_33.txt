**Report on Object o_machine_splitter01**

On April 6, 2023, at 10:58:20 UTC, the machine identified as o_machine_splitter01, located at workstation o_workstation_1, performed its first operation by creating SteelSheet[5380] from SteelCoil[1]. The steel sheet weighed 0.02117 kg, while the steel coil had a mass of 31.91076 kg. This cutting process lasted 13.825 seconds, emitting 0.0144564582 kg of CO2. The operation consumed 0.0211221 kWh of electric energy and produced 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

Later that same day, at 10:59:02 UTC, the same machine split a steel sheet identified as o_steelsheet_5383, also derived from SteelCoil[1]. This operation took approximately 13.80 seconds, generating CO2 emissions of 0.01443 kg and producing 0.00042 kg of steel waste. The electric consumption for this process was recorded as 0.0210835 kWh, with the resulting steel sheet matching the earlier weight of 0.02117 kg.

At 11:11:42 UTC, o_machine_splitter01 performed another splitting operation, producing SteelSheet[o_steelsheet_5436] from the same SteelCoil[o_steelcoil_1]. This operation lasted 14.3912478204 seconds, resulting in CO2 emissions of 0.0150477762 kg and consuming 0.0219866 kWh of electric power. The resulting steel sheet weighed slightly more at 0.02118 kg, and 0.00042 kg of steel waste was again generated for recycling.

Further, at 11:15:16 UTC, a split operation was conducted on SteelCoil[1], resulting in the creation of SteelSheet[5451] with a mass of 0.0213 kg. This operation had a duration of approximately 13.92 seconds, generating 0.01455 kg of CO2 emissions and consuming 0.0212621 kWh from the grid, along with the production of 0.00042 kg of steel waste.

Finally, at 11:18:49 UTC, o_machine_splitter01 processed SteelCoil[1] once more to create SteelSheet[5466], which weighed 0.02122 kg. This operation took about 14.26 seconds, leading to CO2 emissions of 0.01491 kg and consuming 0.02178 kWh of electric energy, while generating another 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

In summary, the machine performed multiple operations on the same steel coil, leading to the production of various steel sheets and generating consistent emissions and waste quantities, while consuming electric power from the grid across all events.
