**Summary Report for Object: o_machine_splitter01**

On April 3, 2023, machine splitter01 operated at Workstation[1] in a series of steel sheet splitting events. 

1. **Event 1**: At 08:23:36 UTC, a steel sheet was split, resulting in a product weighing 0.02104 kg from a steel coil, SteelCoil[4] (mass: 31.91076 kg), over a duration of 14.228 seconds. Emissions were 0.0148771866 kg of CO2, and the process consumed 0.0217372 kWh of electricity, generating 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

2. **Event 2**: At 08:25:15 UTC, another steel sheet (ID: SteelSheet[299], mass: 0.02124 kg) was produced from the same steel coil, SteelCoil[4]. This operation lasted 14.1736385782 seconds, with emissions of 0.0148204146 kg of CO2 and electricity consumption of 0.0216542 kWh, while also generating 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

3. **Event 3**: A splitting process occurred at 08:53:27 UTC, producing a steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[418] weighing 0.02123 kg, again from SteelCoil[4]. This operation took approximately 14.07 seconds, resulted in CO2 emissions of 0.01471 kg, and consumed 0.0214911 kWh of electricity, alongside producing a negligible amount of steel waste (0.00042 kg) intended for recycling.

4. **Event 4**: At 08:58:51 UTC, a steel sheet (ID: SteelSheet[441], mass: 0.02114 kg) was split from the same steel coil. The operation lasted about 14.53 seconds, with emissions of 0.015196341 kg of CO2 and an energy consumption of roughly 0.0222038 kWh, yielding an identical waste output of 0.00042 kg for recycling.

5. **Event 5**: Finally, at 08:59:05 UTC, another steel sheet (ID: SteelSheet[442], mass: 0.02116 kg) was split using machine splitter01 from SteelCoil[4]. This operation lasted approximately 14.1 seconds, resulting in CO2 emissions of 0.01475 kg and requiring 0.0215514 kWh of electricity, producing yet again 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

Throughout the day, the machine consistently utilized the same steel coil, and emissions, energy consumption, and waste production remained relatively stable across all operations.
