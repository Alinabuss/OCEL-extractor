On April 6, 2023, several operations were carried out within the manufacturing environment. 

At 12:06:25 UTC, a coating process was performed on a formed part with ID o_formedpart_5593. This process took 300 seconds and resulted in CO2 emissions of approximately 0.1751 kg. The operation consumed 0.25 kWh of electrical energy and utilized 0.0004 kg of coating material, with a minimal waste of 0.0001 kg generated. The coating was conducted at workstation o_workstation_1 using machine ID o_machine_coater03.

Shortly thereafter, at 12:10:10 UTC, a cutting operation took place on a female part identified as FemalePart[5390]. The operation, which lasted approximately 12.47 seconds, was executed using machine ID Machine[cutter01] at Workstation[2]. This process resulted in the creation of a formed part with ID FormedPart[5390]. Resource consumption during this operation included 0.019 kWh of electric power from the grid, 0.092 cubic meters of compressed air, and 0.076 cubic meters of nitrogen gas, with the same volume of nitrogen gas emitted into the air. The operation also generated 0.00256 kg of steel waste and recorded CO2 emissions of 0.08981 kg.

At 12:17:33 UTC, another coating operation was completed at Workstation[1], which involved a formed part with ID FormedPart[5640]. This coating process took 300 seconds and produced CO2 emissions of 0.1751156951 kg, utilizing machine ID Machine[coater03]. The energy consumption for this operation was 0.25 kWh, with 0.0004 kg of coating material used and a waste of 0.0001 kg.

Following this, at 12:17:41 UTC, a cutting operation was conducted involving a female part labeled FemalePart[5345]. This operation lasted approximately 12.47 seconds at Workstation[2] using machine ID Machine[cutter01]. The energy consumed during this process was 0.019 kWh, producing CO2 emissions of 0.0827 kg. The operation required 0.071 cubic meters of compressed air and utilized 0.076 cubic meters of nitrogen gas, with the same volume also emitted into the air, resulting in a steel waste of 0.00254 kg.

Lastly, at 12:18:31 UTC, a forming process was executed involving a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_5644, which had a mass of 0.02116 kg. This process occurred at workstation o_workstation_1, using machine o_machine_former02 and lasted 5.0 seconds. The forming operation resulted in the creation of a formed part with ID o_formedpart_5644, generating CO2 emissions of 0.0028500228 kg, while consuming 0.0041667 kWh of electricity from the grid. 

These events collectively illustrate a busy day of manufacturing processes on April 6, 2023, highlighting the interrelationship of the components and operations involved.
