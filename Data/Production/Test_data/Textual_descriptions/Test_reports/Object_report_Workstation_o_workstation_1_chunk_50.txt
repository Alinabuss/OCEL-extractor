**Report for Workstation o_workstation_1**

On April 6, 2023, a series of operations took place at workstation o_workstation_1 involving heating and splitting processes of steel sheets and coils.

1. At 08:17:18 UTC, a heating process was performed on a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_4697, weighing 0.02119 kg. This operation utilized machine o_machine_oven01 and lasted for 900 seconds. During this time, the process consumed 0.02 kWh of electricity, 0.49392 Wh of gas, and emitted 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2, with an emissions output of 0.49392 Wh of burned gas.

2. Shortly after, at 08:18:16 UTC, another heating process occurred for the steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[4701], which had a mass of 0.02116 kg. This procedure also lasted for 900 seconds, with similar consumption and emission details: 0.02 kWh of electricity, 0.49392 Wh of gas, and CO2 emissions recorded at 0.0138019093344 kg.

3. The next operation was a splitting process at 08:23:59 UTC, where machine splitter01 split a steel coil with ID 1 to produce a new steel sheet with ID 4729. This activity lasted approximately 14.586 seconds and emitted 0.015251 kg of CO2. The electrical consumption for this operation was 0.0222844 kWh, and it generated 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling. The steel coil weighed 31.91076 kg, while the resulting steel sheet had a mass of 0.02121 kg.

4. Another splitting operation took place at 08:24:43 UTC, where Splitter01 split a steel coil with ID SteelCoil[1] to produce a steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[4732]. This process lasted 13.775 seconds, generating 0.014403927 kg of CO2 emissions and 0.00042 kg of steel waste designated for recycling. The operation consumed 0.0210453 kWh of electricity, and the newly created steel sheet weighed 0.02121 kg.

5. Finally, at 08:26:37 UTC, machine o_machine_oven01 initiated another heating process for a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_4736, which had a mass of 0.02137 kg. This operation lasted for 900 seconds and consumed 0.02 kWh of electricity as well as 0.49392 Wh of gas, resulting in emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 and 0.49392 Wh of burned gas.

Throughout these processes, the workstation and its associated machines demonstrated consistent operations in terms of energy consumption and emissions while handling various steel sheets and coils.
