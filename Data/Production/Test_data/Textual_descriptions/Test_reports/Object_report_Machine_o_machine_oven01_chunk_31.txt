On April 6, 2023, two heating operations involving steel sheets using the machine identified as o_machine_oven01, located at workstation o_workstation_1, were conducted.

1. At 12:46:02 UTC, a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_5830, weighing 0.02113 kg, was heated for 900 seconds. During this process, the power usage from the grid was recorded at 0.02 kWh, with a gas input of 0.49392 Wh. This operation resulted in a carbon dioxide equivalent emission of 0.0138019093344 kg, alongside an emission of 0.49392 Wh from the burn.

2. Subsequently, at 12:46:34 UTC, a steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[5832], weighing 0.02119 kg, was heated for the same duration of 900 seconds. This operation mirrored the previous one in terms of energy consumption, with 0.02 kWh used from the grid, a gas input of 0.49392 Wh, and a recorded carbon dioxide emission of 0.0138019093344 kg. The burn process also resulted in an emission of 0.49392 Wh.

Both heating operations were performed at the same workstation and used identical parameters, showcasing the efficiency and consistency of o_machine_oven01.
