On April 3, 2023, several significant processes took place. 

At 10:21:55 UTC, a steel sheet weighing 0.02128 kg was transformed into a formed part through a process that lasted 5.0 seconds, using a machine at workstation 1. This process emitted 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 and consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electricity.

Shortly after, at 10:26:38 UTC, a coating process was executed on a formed part with the ID o_formedpart_738. The operation used machine o_machine_coater03 at workstation o_workstation_1, taking 300 seconds. This process resulted in 0.1751156951 kg of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, consumed 0.25 kWh of electric energy from the grid, and utilized 0.0004 kg of coating material, producing 0.0001 kg of waste. 

At 10:28:02 UTC, another coating process occurred involving a formed part identified as FormedPart[742], performed using the same machine and workstation. The operation also lasted 300 seconds and recorded the same energy consumption and emissions as the previous coating operation, further emphasizing the efficiency in utilizing the resources with 0.0004 kg of coating material consumed and 0.0001 kg of waste produced.

Continuing at 10:33:18 UTC, a coating process was performed on the formed part with ID o_formedpart_766, again using the machine o_machine_coater03 at workstation o_workstation_1. This operation also lasted for 300 seconds and mirrored earlier outputs, resulting in emissions of 0.175 kg of CO2 equivalent, with similar consumption of 0.25 kWh of electricity and use of 0.0004 kg of coating material, producing 0.0001 kg of waste.

Finally, at 10:33:47 UTC, a formed part with ID o_formedpart_554 was processed at workstation o_workstation_2 by the machine labeled o_machine_cutter01. This operation produced a male part with ID o_malepart_554 and lasted approximately 9.88 seconds. During this event, the process emitted 0.0665 kg of CO2 and consumed 0.0151 kWh of electricity, along with 0.057 m³ of compressed air and 0.06 m³ of N2 gas. It was noted that while 0.06 m³ of N2 gas was emitted, the steel waste generated from this operation could not be quantified. 

This summary captures all the key operations and interactions between the formed parts, machines, and workstations on April 3, 2023.
