On April 3, 2023, several significant operations were conducted involving various steel sheets and male parts at Workstation[1] and Workstation[2]. 

The first operation occurred at 12:13:33 UTC, where a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[1189], weighing 0.02116 kg, was processed using Machine[former02] at Workstation[1]. This operation lasted 5.0 seconds and resulted in the creation of FormedPart[1189]. It resulted in a CO2 emission of 0.0028500228 kg, with an energy consumption of approximately 0.0041667 kWh from the grid.

Shortly after, at 12:19:21 UTC, a heating process began for another steel sheet, SteelSheet[1281], which has a mass of 0.02115 kg. This heating, conducted over 900 seconds using Machine[oven01] at Workstation[1], produced a CO2 equivalent emission of 0.0138019093344 kg. Energy consumption was recorded at 0.02 kWh, with a gas input of 0.49392 Wh, matched by an equivalent emission from burning.

At 12:22:18 UTC, a cutting operation was executed at Workstation[2], using Machine[cutter01] to process the previously formed part, FormedPart[894], resulting in a male part identified as malepart_894. This operation lasted approximately 10.06 seconds, consuming 0.0153721 kWh of electricity and emitting 0.061 m³ of nitrogen gas alongside a carbon dioxide equivalent of 0.0645 kg. Some steel waste was also produced, although its weight was unspecified.

This was followed at 12:25:41 UTC by another processing event of a male part at Workstation[2] using machine cutter01. This operation lasted approximately 10.07 seconds, resulting in 0.081 kg of CO2 emission, while consuming 0.01539 kWh of electricity, with similar volumes of 0.091 m³ of compressed air and 0.062 m³ of nitrogen gas being used and emitted into the air. Additional unspecified steel waste was generated.

Finally, at 12:26:03 UTC, a machining process occurred at Workstation[2], utilizing Machine[cutting01] to create MalePart[814] from FormedPart[814]. This operation lasted about 9.95 seconds and consumed 0.0152 kWh of electric energy, along with 0.068 m³ of compressed air and 0.061 m³ of nitrogen gas. The carbon dioxide equivalent emission recorded during this process was 0.071 kg, although the mass associated with both the created male part and the formed part remains unspecified.

In summary, on April 3, 2023, a series of operations involving various machines and workforce activities led to the processing of steel sheets, resulting in several formed parts and male parts, while also generating emissions and waste throughout the day.
