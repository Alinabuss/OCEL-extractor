On April 3, 2023, several manufacturing processes took place at various workstations, primarily focused on the formation and coating of parts. 

At 09:48:13 UTC, a processing operation was conducted to form a steel sheet with ID "o_steelsheet_577," which weighed 0.02128 kg. This operation, executed using the machine identified as "o_machine_former02" at workstation "o_workstation_1," took 5.0 seconds and resulted in the creation of a formed part with ID "o_formedpart_577." The process generated 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions and consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electricity.

Shortly after, at 09:48:32 UTC, a coating process occurred where the formed part with ID "o_formedpart_576" was coated. This operation, conducted using the machine "o_machine_coater03" at the same workstation "o_workstation_1," spanned 300 seconds, involving an electrical input of 0.25 kWh. The process consumed 0.0004 kg of coating material and produced 0.0001 kg of coating material waste, resulting in emissions of 0.1751156951 kg of CO2 equivalent.

The next event transpired at 09:50:32 UTC, where a female part identified as "FemalePart[235]" was transformed into a formed part labeled "FormedPart[235]." This cutting process was performed by the machine "Machine[cutter01]" at workstation "Workstation[2]," lasting 12.48 seconds. The operation emitted 0.08375 kg of CO2 equivalent and utilized several resources: 0.01907 kWh of electricity from the grid, 0.075 m³ of compressed air, and 0.076 m³ of nitrogen gas, while generating 0.00251 kg of steel waste.

Another coating process took place at 09:52:23 UTC, again involving the machine "Coater03" at workstation "Workstation 1," where the formed part with ID "o_formedpart_593" was coated. This operation lasted for 300 seconds and similarly drew 0.25 kWh from the electrical grid. A total of 0.0004 kg of coating material was used, which resulted in 0.1751156951 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions, along with 0.0001 kg of coating material waste.

Lastly, at 09:57:56 UTC, another steel sheet formation occurred, with the input being a steel sheet labeled "SteelSheet[618]" weighing 0.0209 kg. This operation was carried out by the machine "Machine[former02]" at workstation "Workstation[1]," lasting 5.0 seconds and resulting in the transformation of the steel sheet into a formed part identified as "FormedPart[618]." The operation emitted 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 equivalent and consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electricity.

Overall, this day's processes showcased a variety of operations from forming to coating, highlighting the complexity and interrelationships between raw materials, formed parts, and operational machinery.
