On April 4, 2023, several key manufacturing operations took place.

At 08:30:57 UTC, a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[1732], weighing 0.02124 kg, was processed at Workstation[1] using Machine[former02]. This operation lasted for 5 seconds and produced a formed part with the ID FormedPart[1732]. The process generated 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions and consumed approximately 0.0041667 kWh of electrical energy.

Shortly after, at 08:35:59 UTC, another steel sheet, SteelSheet[1753] with a mass of 0.02144 kg, was processed at the same workstation (Workstation[1]) using Machine[former02]. This operation also lasted 5 seconds, leading to the creation of a formed part with ID FormedPart[1753]. During this process, emissions were recorded at about 0.0028500228 kg, and the energy consumption was approximately 0.0041667 kWh.

At 08:42:40 UTC, a formed part identified as o_formedpart_1778 was created from a steel sheet titled o_steelsheet_1778, which had a mass of 0.0213 kg. This formation occurred at workstation o_workstation_1, utilizing machine o_machine_former02. The operation lasted 5 seconds, emitted approximately 0.00285 kg of CO2, and consumed around 0.0041667 kWh of electrical energy from the grid.

Shortly thereafter, at 08:44:37 UTC, another steel sheet (ID: o_steelsheet_1788, weight: 0.02135 kg) was processed at o_workstation_1, utilizing the same machine, o_machine_former02. This operation produced a formed part with ID o_formedpart_1788, lasting 5 seconds and generating emissions of 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 while consuming about 0.0041667 kWh of electricity.

Later, at 08:57:03 UTC, Machine[cutter01] was utilized at Workstation[2] to cut a male part identified as MalePart[1441]. The cutting operation took approximately 10.06 seconds and outputted the male part, using FormedPart[1441] as input. This process led to the generation of 0.064 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions and consumed 0.0154 kWh of electrical energy, as well as 0.053 m³ of compressed air and 0.061 m³ of nitrogen gas, which was also emitted to the air. Additionally, an undefined amount of steel waste was generated during this operation. 

This summarizes the events that occurred on April 4, 2023, highlighting the processing and cutting activities involving various steel sheets and formed parts across different workstations.
