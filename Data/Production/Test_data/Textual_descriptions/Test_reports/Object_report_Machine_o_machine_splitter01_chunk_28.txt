**Report for Object: o_machine_splitter01**

On April 6, 2023, machine identified as Splitter01 located at Workstation[1] processed a steel coil, SteelCoil[1], weighing 31.91076 kg in multiple operations throughout the day.

1. **First Operation**: At 07:40:02 UTC, the machine split SteelCoil[1], resulting in SteelSheet[4447] with a mass of 0.02106 kg. This operation took 6.6228 seconds, emitted 0.0069297906 kg of CO2 equivalent, consumed 0.0101182 kWh of electricity, and produced 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

2. **Second Operation**: The next process occurred at 07:43:35 UTC, when the machine began splitting, again utilizing SteelCoil[1] as input. This activity lasted approximately 6.69 seconds and produced SteelSheet[o_steelsheet_4479] weighing 0.0213 kg. It emitted 0.0070029786 kg of CO2 equivalent, used 0.0102252 kWh of electricity, and generated 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling. 

3. **Third Operation**: At 07:59:48 UTC, Splitter01 processed SteelCoil[1], resulting in SteelSheet[4626] with a mass of 0.02105 kg. This operation had a duration of approximately 6.666 seconds, emitting 0.006975 kg of CO2, consuming about 0.0101843 kWh of electricity, and producing 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

4. **Fourth Operation**: Following this, at 08:23:59 UTC, the machine split SteelCoil[1] again, creating a new steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[4729]. This process lasted approximately 14.586 seconds, producing 0.015251 kg of CO2 emissions, using 0.0222844 kWh of electricity from the grid, and generating 0.00042 kg of steel waste. The resultant steel sheet weighed 0.02121 kg.

5. **Fifth Operation**: Finally, at 08:24:43 UTC, Splitter01 operated once more, splitting SteelCoil[1] to produce SteelSheet[4732], which weighed 0.02121 kg. This operation lasted 13.7751 seconds, emitted 0.014403927 kg of CO2, consumed 0.0210453 kWh of electricity, and produced 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

Throughout these operations, a consistent relationship between SteelCoil[1] and the resultant steel sheets was maintained, highlighting the effective processing capabilities of machine Splitter01.
