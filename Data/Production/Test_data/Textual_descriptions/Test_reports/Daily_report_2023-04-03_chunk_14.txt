On April 3, 2023, several critical processes were executed involving various machines and parts within the designated workstations.

At 11:46:11 UTC, the cutting process commenced at Workstation[2] utilizing Machine[cutting01]. This activity involved cutting a male part, resulting in the creation of MalePart[611]. The operation lasted approximately 9.99 seconds and consumed 0.0152648 kilowatt-hours of electricity, 0.052 cubic meters of compressed air, and 0.061 cubic meters of nitrogen gas. Interestingly, during this event, there was also an emission of 0.061 cubic meters of nitrogen gas into the air. This cutting process was directly linked to the formed part identified as FormedPart[611].

Shortly after, at 11:50:49 UTC, Machine[former02] at Workstation[1] undertook a forming operation on SteelSheet[1091]. This operation, which lasted for 5.0 seconds, generated a formed part labeled as FormedPart[1091]. The input, SteelSheet[1091], had a mass of 0.02113 kg, and the operation consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electricity while producing CO2 emissions of 0.0028500228 kg.

At 11:50:52 UTC, a heating operation commenced involving steel sheet ID o_steelsheet_1161, which had a mass of 0.02109 kg. This process utilized machine o_machine_oven01 at workstation o_workstation_1 and lasted for 900 seconds. During this heating, there was a CO2 equivalent emission of 0.0138019093344 kg, and it consumed 0.02 kWh of electricity along with 0.49392 Wh of gas, which also produced identical emissions from the burning process.

Shortly thereafter, at 11:51:14 UTC, Machine[1], located at Workstation[2], initiated another cutting process using FemalePart[628] as input. This operation lasted approximately 12.49 seconds and resulted in the output of FemalePart[628], which had been derived from FormedPart[628]. The activity generated CO2 equivalent emissions of 0.0841 kg, consumed 0.0191 kWh of electricity, and utilized 0.077 cubic meters of compressed air as well as 0.076 cubic meters of nitrogen gas, with a corresponding emission of 0.076 cubic meters of nitrogen gas into the atmosphere. Additionally, a small amount of steel waste, approximately 0.00252 kg, was produced during this operation.

Finally, at 11:52:25 UTC, another heating process was conducted at Workstation[1] involving the steel sheet labeled SteelSheet[1168], known to have a mass of 0.02124 kg. This heating process, performed by machine Machine[oven01], lasted 900 seconds and generated emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent. During this operation, the machine consumed 0.02 kWh of electricity and utilized 0.49392 Wh of gas, generating an equal emission from the burning process. 

These events collectively illustrate the intricate and energy-consuming manufacturing activities at the various workstations on April 3, 2023.
