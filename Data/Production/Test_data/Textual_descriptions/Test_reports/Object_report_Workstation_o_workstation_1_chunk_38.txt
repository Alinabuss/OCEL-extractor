**Report for Object o_workstation_1**

On April 5, 2023, several significant operations involving steel sheets were performed at workstation ID o_workstation_1, which is associated with machine ID o_machine_oven01 and Machine[splitter01].

1. **Heating Process (o_steelsheet_3374)**: 
   - **Timestamp**: April 5, 2023, at 08:53:28 UTC  
   - A steel sheet identified as o_steelsheet_3374, weighing 0.02125 kg, underwent a heating process classified as HeatSteelSheet. 
   - **Duration**: 900 seconds  
   - During this operation, emissions were recorded at 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent. 
   - Energy consumption included 0.02 kWh from the grid, with a gas input and emissions from burning both recorded at 0.49392 Wh.

2. **Splitting Operation**: 
   - **Timestamp**: April 5, 2023, at 09:00:21 UTC  
   - A splitting operation occurred involving a steel coil (ID SteelCoil[2]) and resulting in a new steel sheet (ID SteelSheet[3407]). 
   - Conducted with Machine[splitter01], this process lasted approximately 14.16 seconds and emitted about 0.0148 kg of CO2 equivalent. 
   - The operation used 0.0216 kWh of electricity and produced 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

3. **Heat Treatment (o_steelsheet_3441)**: 
   - **Timestamp**: April 5, 2023, at 09:09:22 UTC  
   - Another heat treatment was performed on a steel sheet (ID o_steelsheet_3441). 
   - **Duration**: 900 seconds  
   - This process, also a HeatSteelSheet, was conducted on o_machine_oven01 with the same energy metrics as the previous heating: 0.02 kWh from the grid, gas input of 0.49392 Wh, and emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent. The processed steel sheetâ€™s mass was 0.0212 kg.

4. **Second Heating Process (SteelSheet[3449])**: 
   - **Timestamp**: April 5, 2023, at 09:11:15 UTC  
   - A heating operation was conducted on another steel sheet, identified as SteelSheet[3449], with a mass of 0.02118 kg. 
   - **Duration**: 900 seconds  
   - This process utilized 0.02 kWh of energy from the grid and produced emissions of approximately 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent, along with gas input and burn emissions both at 0.49392 Wh.

5. **Second Splitting Operation**: 
   - **Timestamp**: April 5, 2023, at 09:14:36 UTC  
   - Another split operation was executed on a steel sheet (ID SteelSheet[3467]), which was created from the same steel coil (ID SteelCoil[2], mass 31.91076 kg). 
   - **Duration**: 14.266 seconds  
   - This operation resulted in a CO2 emission of 0.014917 kg and consumed 0.0217954 kWh of electricity from the grid, along with generating 0.00042 kg of steel waste intended for recycling.

All operations took place at station o_workstation_1, reflecting an active day in the processing of steel sheets through both heating and splitting procedures.
