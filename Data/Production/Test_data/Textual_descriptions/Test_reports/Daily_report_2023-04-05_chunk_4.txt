On April 5, 2023, a series of manufacturing processes were executed, each involving various parts, machines, and workstations.

At 10:02:36 UTC, a workstation identified as "o_workstation_1" was utilized to form a steel sheet, specifically "o_steelsheet_3598" with a mass of 0.02107 kg. This process employed the machine "o_machine_former02" and resulted in the creation of a formed part labeled "o_formedpart_3598". The operation lasted for 5 seconds, during which it consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electricity and emitted 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 equivalent.

Shortly after, at 10:03:18 UTC, a cutting operation was conducted at workstation with ID "Workstation[2]", using the machine "Machine[cutter01]". This operation involved the formed part ID FormedPart[3266], and after approximately 9.87 seconds, it produced a male part labeled "MalePart[3266]". During this process, a total of 0.0687 kg of CO2 equivalent was emitted, and 0.0151 kWh of electricity was consumed. Additionally, 0.061 m³ of compressed air and 0.06 m³ of nitrogen gas were utilized, forming a reciprocal emission of nitrogen gas.

At 10:06:51 UTC, a further forming process was executed using the steel sheet ID "SteelSheet[3616]", which weighed 0.02114 kg. The operation was conducted at "Workstation[1]" employing "Machine[former02]" and took 5 seconds, generating a new formed part labeled "FormedPart[3616]". This process consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electricity and emitted 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 equivalent.

Subsequently, at 10:11:32 UTC, another cutting operation occurred at "workstation 2". This operation, lasting approximately 10.04 seconds, was executed using "machine cutter 01" and resulted in the male part identified as "MalePart[3358]", processed from the formed part labeled "FormedPart[3358]". The cutting process consumed 0.01533 kWh of electricity and emitted 0.07016 kg of CO2 equivalent. It also produced 0.069 m³ of compressed air and utilized 0.061 m³ of nitrogen gas, with an equivalent amount being emitted.

Finally, at 10:13:58 UTC, a female part with ID "o_femalepart_3238" was produced. This part underwent cutting using "o_machine_cutter01" at "workstation o_workstation_2". Although the mass of the female part was not specified, the cutting process lasted approximately 12.52 seconds, yielding 0.084 kg of CO2 emissions. It consumed 0.0191284 kWh of electricity, along with 0.071 m³ of compressed air and 0.077 m³ of nitrogen gas, which was matched by the volume emitted. The operation also generated 0.00255 kg of steel waste, with the formed part labeled "o_formedpart_3238" serving as the input to this process.

Each of these events highlights the intricate relationships between the various workstations, machines, and parts involved in the manufacturing operations on this date.
