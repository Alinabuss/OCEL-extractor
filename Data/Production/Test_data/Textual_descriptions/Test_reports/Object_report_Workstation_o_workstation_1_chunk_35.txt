**Report for Object: o_workstation_1**

On April 5, 2023, at workstation o_workstation_1, several significant processes involving heating and splitting of steel sheets were recorded.

1. At 07:48:22 UTC, a steel sheet identified as o_steelsheet_3039, weighing 0.02134 kg, underwent heating for 900 seconds using machine o_machine_oven01. The operation emitted 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2e, consumed 0.02 kWh of electricity from the grid, and utilized 0.49392 Wh of gas input, which produced an equivalent amount of emissions from combustion.

2. Just 14 seconds later, at 07:48:36 UTC, another steel sheet, o_steelsheet_3041, weighing 0.02114 kg, was heated at the same workstation and with the same machine for 900 seconds. This operation also recorded emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg CO2e, an energy input of 0.02 kWh from the grid, and a gas input of 0.49392 Wh, along with equivalent emissions from burning.

3. Shortly after, at 07:56:56 UTC, the machine o_machine_splitter01 carried out a splitting operation at workstation o_workstation_1. This process utilized a steel coil with ID o_steelcoil_2, weighing 31.91076 kg, to create a steel sheet identified as o_steelsheet_3125, weighing 0.02114 kg, lasting for 6.773 seconds. The operation produced approximately 0.0070867686 kg of CO2e, consumed 0.0103477 kWh of electric energy, and generated 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

4. At 08:00:32 UTC, heating resumed at the workstation with steel sheet o_steelsheet_3149. This heating process lasted for 900 seconds, emitted 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2e, and used 0.02 kWh from the grid alongside a gas input of 0.49392 Wh, mirroring emissions from combustion, all conducted with machine o_machine_oven01.

5. Finally, at 08:09:57 UTC, the heating of a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[3191], weighing 0.02129 kg, occurred for 900 seconds at workstation Workstation[1]. This operation continued using machine Machine[oven01], consuming 0.02 kWh from the grid and 0.49392 Wh of gas input, resulting in an emission total of 0.49392 Wh and a CO2e equivalent of approximately 0.0138019093344 kg.

In summary, all heating operations utilized o_machine_oven01 and the workstation o_workstation_1, with consistent energy inputs and emissions recorded across the various processes. The splitting operation, executed by o_machine_splitter01, was crucial in creating a new steel sheet from existing materials at the same workstation.
