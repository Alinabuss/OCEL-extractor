On April 4, 2023, at 08:33:52 UTC, a workstation identified as Workstation[1] initiated a splitting operation for a steel sheet labeled SteelSheet[1816], weighing 0.02121 kg. This operation utilized a steel coil, SteelCoil[3], weighing 31.91076 kg, and was executed using Machine[splitter01], which is located at the same workstation. The task took approximately 14.53 seconds to complete and resulted in carbon dioxide equivalent emissions of 0.0152 kg. During this process, the workstation drew 0.0222057 kWh of energy from the grid and produced a negligible amount of steel waste, specifically 0.00042 kg, designated for recycling. The steel sheet produced was directly created from the steel coil involved in the operation.
