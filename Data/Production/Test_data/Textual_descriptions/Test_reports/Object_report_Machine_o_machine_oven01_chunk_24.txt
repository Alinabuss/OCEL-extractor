### Report on Heating Processes Involving o_machine_oven01

On April 6, 2023, a series of heating processes took place using the machine identified as **o_machine_oven01**, located at the workstation **o_workstation_1**. 

1. **Event 1:** At **08:55:07 UTC**, a heating process named **HeatSteelSheet** was conducted involving a steel sheet with ID **o_steelsheet_4856**, which had a mass of **0.02112 kg**. The operation lasted for **900 seconds** and recorded an energy consumption of **0.02 kWh** along with a gas input of **0.49392 Wh**. This resulted in carbon emissions of approximately **0.0138019093344 kg CO2e** and an equivalent emission from the burning process of **0.49392 Wh**.

2. **Event 2:** At **09:07:53 UTC**, another heating process was initiated for a steel sheet with ID **SteelSheet[4910]** for a duration of **900 seconds**. This operation produced emissions of about **0.0138019093344 kg CO2e**, while also consuming **0.02 kWh** of electric energy and using **0.49392 Wh** for gas input, along with a similar amount for burning emissions.

3. **Event 3:** Following this, at **09:10:33 UTC**, a heating process was performed for a steel sheet with ID **o_steelsheet_4921**, which weighed **0.02109 kg**. This operation also lasted **900 seconds**, consuming **0.02 kWh** of energy, with emissions of **0.0138019093344 kg CO2e**, and gas input along with burning emissions both totaling **0.49392 Wh**.

4. **Event 4:** At **09:15:01 UTC**, a heat treatment was carried out for a steel sheet identified as **SteelSheet[4940]**, weighing **0.0212 kg**. This process also lasted for **900 seconds**, consuming **0.02 kWh** of electrical energy and **0.49392 Wh** of gas input, leading to carbon emissions of approximately **0.0138 kg CO2e** from burning.

5. **Event 5:** Finally, at **09:21:42 UTC**, another heating operation took place with a steel sheet identified as **o_steelsheet_4968**, which had a mass of **0.02116 kg**. The heating took **900 seconds**, producing emissions of **0.0138019093344 kg CO2e**. The energy consumption again was **0.02 kWh**, with gas input and burning emissions each at **0.49392 Wh**.

All these events illustrate the operational consistency and environmental impact associated with the use of **o_machine_oven01** at **o_workstation_1** throughout the specified timeframe.
