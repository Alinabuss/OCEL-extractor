**Report for Object: o_machine_oven01**

On April 4, 2023, multiple heating processes were conducted using the machine identified as **o_machine_oven01**, located at **workstation o_workstation_1**. 

1. The first process occurred at **09:30:13 UTC**, involving a steel sheet with ID **o_steelsheet_2050**, weighing **0.02117 kg**. This heating lasted **900 seconds** and led to a CO2 emission of **0.0138019093344 kg**. Energy consumption included **0.02 kWh** of electricity and **0.49392 Wh** of gas input, resulting in equivalent emissions from burning.

2. Another heating event took place at **09:32:51 UTC** for steel sheet ID **o_steelsheet_2061**, with a mass of **0.02116 kg**. Similar to the previous process, it lasted **900 seconds** and produced **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2 emissions. The electricity consumption was again **0.02 kWh**, accompanied by **0.49392 Wh** of gas input, also with equivalent emissions from burning.

3. At **09:37:50 UTC**, a heating process was performed on a steel sheet identified as **o_steelsheet_2082**, which weighed **0.0214 kg**. This process also lasted **900 seconds** and resulted in an emission of **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2. The machine consumed **0.02 kWh** of electricity and used **0.49392 Wh** of gas input, consistent with the emissions from burning.

4. The fourth event occurred at **09:49:44 UTC**, involving steel sheet **SteelSheet[2132]**, with a mass of **0.02125 kg**. It lasted **900 seconds** and emitted **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2 equivalent. The process recorded an electricity consumption of **0.02 kWh** and a gas input of **0.49392 Wh**, producing equivalent burn emissions.

5. The last heating process for the day was at **09:50:42 UTC**, on steel sheet ID **o_steelsheet_2136**, weighing **0.02111 kg**. This process, lasting **900 seconds**, produced **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2 emissions, utilized **0.02 kWh** of electricity, and had a gas input of **0.49392 Wh**, with a corresponding burn emission.

All processes used the same machine, **o_machine_oven01**, located consistently at **workstation o_workstation_1** throughout the day.
