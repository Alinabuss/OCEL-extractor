**Report on Events Involving o_machine_splitter01**

On April 3, 2023, the machine identified as o_machine_splitter01, located at Workstation o_workstation_1, conducted several splitting operations on steel coils, resulting in the production of various steel sheets.

1. **First Operation**: At 07:55:26 UTC, a splitting operation was performed, lasting approximately 6.76 seconds. This operation processed a steel coil ID o_steelcoil_4, weighing 31.91076 kg, to produce a steel sheet with ID SteelSheet 151, weighing 0.021 kg. The operation generated 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling and emitted 0.0070691214 kg of CO2 equivalent while consuming 0.0103219 kWh of electricity from the grid.

2. **Second Operation**: Just over a minute later, at 07:56:39 UTC, the splitter executed another splitting operation, labeled SplitSteelSheet, lasting 6.624 seconds. It again utilized the steel coil o_steelcoil_4 to create a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_162, weighing 0.02112 kg. This process resulted in 0.0069312954 kg of CO2 emissions and produced 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling, consuming 0.0101204 kWh of electricity.

3. **Third Operation**: At 08:11:15 UTC, the machine conducted a longer splitting operation, lasting approximately 14.36 seconds. This event utilized the same steel coil, o_steelcoil_4, producing a new steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_240, which had a mass of 0.021 kg. Emissions recorded for this event amounted to 0.015 kg of CO2, with electricity consumption at 0.0219376 kWh, while generating 0.00042 kg of steel waste.

4. **Fourth Operation**: Shortly after, at 08:19:34 UTC, the machine executed another splitting operation lasting 14.14 seconds, again using o_steelcoil_4. This produced a steel sheet with mass 0.02108 kg, accompanied by CO2 emissions of 0.01478 kg and electricity consumption of 0.0216 kWh. Steel waste generated was approximately 0.00042 kg.

5. **Fifth Operation**: Finally, at 08:20:32 UTC, o_machine_splitter01 carried out a splitting operation which lasted about 14.31 seconds. This operation produced a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_279 from steel coil ID o_steelcoil_4, with the resulting sheet weighing 0.02117 kg. This event also resulted in CO2 emissions of 0.015 kg, consumed 0.0219 kWh of electricity, and produced 0.00042 kg of steel waste.

Throughout all operations, the relationship with the steel coil o_steelcoil_4 was consistent, as all produced sheets originated from this single coil, highlighting the efficient processing capabilities of machine o_machine_splitter01 at Workstation o_workstation_1.
