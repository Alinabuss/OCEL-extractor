On April 3, 2023, several forming processes took place, all utilizing the same workstation and machine. 

At 08:11:36 UTC, a Forming process occurred at Workstation with ID Workstation[1]. This process involved Machine with ID Machine[former02], which processed a SteelSheet with ID SteelSheet[144], weighing 0.0212 kg. The formation resulted in the creation of a FormedPart with ID FormedPart[144]. The operation lasted 5.0 seconds, producing emissions of 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 equivalent and consuming approximately 0.0041667 kWh from the grid.

Shortly thereafter, at 08:11:48 UTC, another operation took place at the same Workstation[1]. This timeframe saw a machine, identified as o_machine_former02, process a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_151, which weighed 0.021 kg. The output was a formed part designated as o_formedpart_151. This process also lasted 5 seconds and mirrored the emissions and electricity consumption of the previous operation, with 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 equivalent and 0.0041667 kWh consumed from the grid.

At 08:12:17 UTC, a separate steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[145], having a mass of 0.02131 kg, was processed by Machine[former02] at Workstation[1]. This formed part was labeled as FormedPart[145]. The duration of this event was again 5 seconds, yielding the same emissions of 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 and an electrical consumption of 0.0041667 kWh.

Later in the day, at 08:17:17 UTC, another steel sheet, ID o_steelsheet_194, weighing 0.02124 kg, was formed into part o_formedpart_194 at workstation o_workstation_1 with machine o_machine_former02. This operation lasted for 5 seconds, maintaining the same emission factors and electricity consumption as prior processes, resulting in 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 equivalent and utilizing 0.0041667 kWh.

Finally, at 08:27:07 UTC, a steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[234], weighing 0.0212 kg, was processed at Workstation[1], producing a formed part identified as FormedPart[234]. This operation took 5.0 seconds and caused emissions of 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 equivalent, alongside the same consumption of 0.0041667 kWh from the grid.

In summary, all operations on April 3, 2023, consistently utilized the same electrical and emission metrics while varying the IDs and weights of the materials processed.
