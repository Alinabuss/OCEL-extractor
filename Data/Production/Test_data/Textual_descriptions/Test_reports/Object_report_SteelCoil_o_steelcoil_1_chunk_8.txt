On April 6, 2023, multiple operations involving the object o_steelcoil_1 were conducted at Workstation[1] using the machine named Splitter01.

1. At 12:19:29 UTC, Splitter01 initiated a splitting process on SteelCoil[1], resulting in the creation of SteelSheet[5722]. This process took approximately 14.97 seconds and emitted 0.01565 kg of CO2, producing 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling. The energy consumption for this operation was 0.02287 kWh, with the steel coil weighing 31.91076 kg and the resulting steel sheet weighing 0.02114 kg.

2. Shortly after, at 12:44:11 UTC, the same machine performed another split operation on SteelCoil[1], producing SteelSheet[5826]. This operation lasted about 14.37 seconds, generating 0.015 kg of CO2 and also resulting in 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling. The electricity consumption for this task was 0.02195 kWh.

3. At 12:46:04 UTC, Splitter01 again processed SteelCoil[1], which led to the creation of SteelSheet[5834]. This operation took 14.41 seconds, resulting in emissions of 0.01506 kg of CO2 and producing another 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling, while consuming 0.02201 kWh from the grid.

4. Finally, at 12:51:35 UTC, the machine, identified as "Machine Splitter 01," completed another splitting task on SteelSheet[1], resulting in SteelSheet[5857]. This operation, which lasted approximately 13.63 seconds, produced 0.0143 kg of CO2 emissions, redirected 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling, and consumed about 0.02083 kWh from the grid. The original steel coil maintained a mass of 31.91076 kg, while the new steel sheet weighed 0.02119 kg.

In summary, all operations were conducted on SteelCoil[1], leading to the production of four steel sheets, each carrying unique IDs and generating emissions along with steel waste intended for recycling.
