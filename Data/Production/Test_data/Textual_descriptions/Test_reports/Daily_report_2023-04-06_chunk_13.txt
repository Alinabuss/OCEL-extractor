On April 6, 2023, a series of events took place involving various processes and parts.

At 11:47:25 UTC, a part identified as FormedPart[5512] underwent a coating process at Workstation[1], utilizing Machine[coater03]. The process took 300 seconds and resulted in the generation of 0.1751156951 kg of CO2 emissions, consumed 0.25 kWh of electricity, utilized 0.0004 kg of coating material, and produced 0.0001 kg of coating material waste.

Just a few seconds later, at 11:47:33 UTC, a cutting process was executed at Workstation[2] using Machine[01]. This process involved the input of FormedPart[5173] and lasted approximately 10.1 seconds, yielding an output part identified as MalePart[5173]. The cutting resulted in the consumption of 0.0154325 kWh of electrical energy, 0.061 cubic meters of compressed air, and 0.062 cubic meters of nitrogen gas, while emitting around 0.067 kg of CO2 equivalent.

Later, at 11:55:37 UTC, Machine[former02], situated at Workstation[1], performed a forming task on a steel sheet identified as ID 5547, which weighed 0.02118 kg. This operation lasted 5 seconds, resulted in emissions of 0.0028500228 kg of CO2, and consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electricity from the grid.

Shortly after, at 11:56:17 UTC, another coating process commenced at Workstation[1] using Machine[coater03] on a formed part identified as o_formedpart_5548, which had an unspecified mass. This coating operation lasted 300 seconds, emitted 0.1751156951 kg of CO2e, consumed 0.25 kWh of electricity, used 0.0004 kg of coating material, and generated 0.0001 kg of coating material waste.

Lastly, at 12:00:30 UTC, a further coating process was conducted on a part known as FormedPart[5567] utilizing Machine[coater03] at Workstation[1]. This coating process also lasted for 300 seconds and produced approximately 0.175 kg of CO2 equivalent, required 0.25 kWh of electricity, consumed 0.0004 kg of coating material, and generated a small waste of 0.0001 kg of coating material.

Throughout the day, multiple processes involving coating, cutting, and forming took place at Workstation[1] and Workstation[2], demonstrating an interconnected workflow with significant resource consumption and emissions.
