### Summary Report for Object o_machine_oven01

On April 6, 2023, machine identified as o_machine_oven01, located at workstation o_workstation_1, was involved in a series of heating processes on various steel sheets.

1. **Event 1**: At 09:23:37 UTC, a steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[4976] and a mass of 0.02118 kg was heated for 900 seconds, resulting in CO2 equivalent emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg. The operation utilized 0.02 kWh of electric energy and a gas input of 0.49392 Wh, leading to an emission of 0.49392 Wh due to burning.

2. **Event 2**: Shortly after, at 09:29:28 UTC, the machine heated another steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_5001, weighing 0.02127 kg. This process also lasted for 900 seconds and produced the same CO2 equivalent emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg. The energy consumption mirrored the previous operation with 0.02 kWh of electricity from the grid and a gas input of 0.49392 Wh, resulting in identical burning emissions.

3. **Event 3**: At 09:36:10 UTC, another heating process occurred involving the steel sheet ID o_steelsheet_5029, which had a mass of 0.02117 kg. This heating session lasted 900 seconds and emitted 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent. Energy inputs remained consistent with 0.02 kWh of electricity and 0.49392 Wh of gas, leading to the same burning emissions.

4. **Event 4**: The next activity took place at 09:36:50 UTC, where a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_5032, massing 0.02127 kg, was heated for 900 seconds. As with previous events, this operation generated 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions, utilized 0.02 kWh of electricity from the grid, and included a gas input of 0.49392 Wh, with corresponding emissions from burning.

5. **Event 5**: Finally, at 09:46:30 UTC, the machine heated a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[5073]. This operation also lasted for 900 seconds and resulted in CO2 equivalent emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg, employing 0.02 kWh of electricity and a gas input of 0.49392 Wh, corresponding to burn emissions as before.

Overall, during these sequences, machine o_machine_oven01 consistently operated under the same conditions, producing similar outcomes across multiple steel sheet heating processes at workstation o_workstation_1 on the same date.
