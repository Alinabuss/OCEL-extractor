**Summary Report for Object: o_workstation_1**

On April 6, 2023, various operations were carried out at Workstation[1] involving several steel sheets produced from Steel Coil[1].

1. At **11:57:32 UTC**, a split operation was conducted using Machine[splitter01] on a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[5629], weighing **0.02147 kg**. This operation lasted approximately **13.84 seconds**, emitting **0.0144719166 kg** of CO2 equivalent and generating **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling. The operation required **0.0211447 kWh** of electricity. The processed steel sheet was derived from SteelCoil[1], which weighed **31.91076 kg**.

2. At **12:11:29 UTC**, another split operation was performed on a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_5688, weighing **0.02106 kg**, using Machine ID o_machine_splitter01. This process also lasted approximately **13.88 seconds**, generating **0.0145 kg** of CO2 emissions and **0.00042 kg** of steel waste. This steel sheet was created from Steel Coil ID o_steelcoil_1, weighing **31.91076 kg**.

3. At **12:12:51 UTC**, Machine[oven01] processed SteelSheet[5690] using a heating operation that lasted **900 seconds**, emitting approximately **0.0138 kg** of CO2 equivalent. The machine consumed **0.02 kWh** of electricity and utilized **0.49392 Wh** of gas for the process, which had the same amount in emissions from the burning process. The steel sheet processed during this operation weighed **0.02126 kg**.

4. Shortly after, at **12:15:00 UTC**, a heating process was conducted on a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_5699, which had a mass of **0.02107 kg**. This operation, lasting **900 seconds**, emitted **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2 equivalent, consumed **0.02 kWh** of electricity, and utilized **0.49392 Wh** of gas input, with equivalent emissions from burning. The heating was facilitated by Machine ID o_machine_oven01.

5. Finally, at **12:16:53 UTC**, another processing operation took place where Machine[splitter01] processed a steel coil with ID o_steelcoil_1, weighing **31.91076 kg**, resulting in a steel sheet with ID steelsheet_5711, weighing **0.02125 kg**. This operation took approximately **13.785 seconds**, producing **0.014414 kg** of CO2 equivalent emissions and consuming **0.0210607 kWh** of electrical energy from the grid, along with generating a negligible amount of steel waste for recycling, amounting to **0.00042 kg**.

Throughout April 6, 2023, Workstation[1] demonstrated efficient operations involving both splitting and heating of steel sheets with careful monitoring of emissions and energy consumption.
