On April 6, 2023, the steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[4749] underwent two significant operations at Workstation[1].

The first operation was a splitting process conducted at 08:28:44 UTC using Machine[splitter01]. The sheet was split from a steel coil with ID SteelCoil[1]. This operation lasted approximately 14.75 seconds, producing 0.0154 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions and consuming 0.0225 kWh of electricity. Additionally, a small amount of steel waste, measuring 0.00042 kg, was generated and sent for recycling. The spindle utilized for this operation was located at the same workstation.

Subsequently, at 08:29:42 UTC, a heat treatment was performed on SteelSheet[4749], which had a mass of 0.02105 kg. This heating process lasted for 900 seconds and was executed using Machine[oven01]. During this operation, the estimated carbon dioxide emissions were 0.0138019093344 kg. The process consumed 0.02 kWh of electricity and utilized 0.49392 Wh of gas input, resulting in carbon emissions of 0.49392 Wh.

In summary, both operations on SteelSheet[4749] were carried out at Workstation[1], highlighting the efficient use of both electricity and resources during the splitting and heat treatment processes.
