**Report for Object o_workstation_1**

On April 5, 2023, Workstation[1] was involved in multiple processing activities with the machine identified as Machine[splitter01].

1. **Event at 08:33:02 UTC**: The machine processed a steel coil with ID SteelCoil[2], splitting it into a steel sheet designated as SteelSheet[3292]. This operation took approximately 14.90 seconds, resulting in emissions of about 0.016 kg of CO2 equivalent. The process consumed 0.0228 kWh of electricity and generated 0.00042 kg of steel waste intended for recycling. The new steel sheet weighed 0.0213 kg.

2. **Event at 08:33:31 UTC**: In a subsequent operation known as "SplitSteelSheet," a steel sheet was produced from the steel coil (ID o_steelcoil_2, mass 31.91076 kg), creating the steel sheet o_steelsheet_3294, which weighed 0.02125 kg. This activity lasted approximately 14.16 seconds and resulted in CO2 emissions of 0.01481 kg. The operation consumed 0.02163 kWh of electricity and generated 0.00042 kg of steel waste.

3. **Event at 08:44:41 UTC**: Another splitting process again utilized the steel coil SteelCoil[2], producing a new steel sheet labeled SteelSheet[3341], with a mass of 0.02101 kg. The operation lasted about 14.051 seconds, resulting in emissions of 0.0146923698 kg of CO2 equivalent. It consumed 0.021467 kWh of electricity and generated 0.00042 kg of steel waste.

4. **Event at 08:46:47 UTC**: A different operation took place where a steel sheet, identified as o_steelsheet_3346 with a mass of 0.02135 kg, was heated using o_machine_oven01 at workstation o_workstation_1. This heating operation lasted for 900 seconds and emitted 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2e, along with consuming 0.02 kWh of electricity and utilizing 0.49392 Wh of gas input.

5. **Event at 08:47:47 UTC**: Finally, another processing event involved the machine Splitter01, creating a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[3354] from the steel coil weighing 31.91076 kg located at Workstation[1]. This operation occurred in approximately 13.87 seconds and produced 0.0145 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions while consuming 0.0212 kWh of electricity and generating 0.00042 kg of steel waste.

Each of these events highlights the interconnected operations taking place at Workstation[1], demonstrating a continuous transformation involving steel coils and sheets, along with their associated emissions and electricity consumption.
