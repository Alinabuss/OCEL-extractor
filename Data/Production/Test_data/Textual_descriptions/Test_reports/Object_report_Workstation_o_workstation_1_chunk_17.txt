**Combined Report for Object o_workstation_1**

On April 4, 2023, at 07:45:46 UTC, the machine designated as the splitter located at workstation o_workstation_1 performed a splitting operation on a steel coil with ID o_steelcoil_3, which has a mass of 31.91076 kg. This operation generated a steel sheet identified as o_steelsheet_1545, weighing 0.02123 kg. The splitting process took approximately 6.8375 seconds, resulting in 0.0071541426 kg of CO2 emissions and 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

Shortly thereafter, at 07:49:19 UTC, the machine known as Splitter01 at the same workstation processed the same steel coil with a mass of 31.91076 kg, producing a steel sheet weighing 0.02116 kg. This operation lasted for 6.6393 seconds, generating 0.006946959 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions, consumed 0.0101433 kWh of electricity, and again disposed of 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

At 07:49:25 UTC, the machine o_machine_splitter01 at workstation o_workstation_1 performed another splitting operation using the steel coil o_steelcoil_3. This time, it created a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_1578, weighing 0.02111 kg. The process lasted approximately 6.76 seconds, with energy usage recorded at 0.0103353 kWh, carbon dioxide equivalent emissions of 0.007078287 kg, and 0.00042 kg of steel waste allocated for recycling.

Further, at 07:52:18 UTC, a splitting process was conducted on a steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[1604], weighing 0.02117 kg. This activity, executed by Machine[Splitter01] at Workstation[1], took approximately 6.55 seconds, producing a CO2 equivalent emission of 0.0068552346 kg, with an electric consumption of 0.0100092 kWh. The steel sheet was also created from the steel coil with ID SteelCoil[3], weighing 31.91076 kg, and resulted in 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

Finally, at 08:03:53 UTC, the workstation o_workstation_1 conducted a steel sheet splitting process using the machine identified as o_machine_splitter01 with the steel coil o_steelcoil_3. This operation produced a new steel sheet, identified as o_steelsheet_1690, with a mass of 0.02113 kg. It took approximately 14.0037 seconds, generating CO2 emissions of 0.0146 kg, utilizing 0.0214 kWh of electricity, and producing 0.00042 kg of steel waste meant for recycling.
