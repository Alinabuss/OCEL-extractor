### Event Summary Report for Object o_steelcoil_3

On April 4, 2023, object SteelCoil[3], with a mass of 31.91076 kg, was involved in multiple splitting operations at Workstation[1], using the machine identified as Machine[Splitter01].

1. **First Event**: At 10:19:43 UTC, a splitting operation produced SteelSheet[2263], weighing 0.02114 kg. This operation lasted approximately 14.55 seconds, emitting 0.0152 kg of CO2 equivalent and consuming 0.0222 kWh of electricity. Additionally, it generated 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

2. **Second Event**: At 10:25:10 UTC, another splitting operation resulted in SteelSheet[2286], which weighed 0.02106 kg. The process took about 14.96 seconds, involved an energy consumption of 0.0228591 kWh, and emitted approximately 0.0156445662 kg of CO2. This operation produced a minimal amount of steel waste, weighing 0.00042 kg.

3. **Third Event**: At 10:37:00 UTC, a split steel sheet process involved the same steel coil, producing a sheet that weighed 0.02126 kg. The operation took approximately 13.911 seconds, generating 0.014546 kg of CO2 emissions and requiring electricity from the grid. It also resulted in 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

4. **Fourth Event**: At 10:37:56 UTC, another operation took place, yielding SteelSheet[2340] with a weight of 0.021 kg. This process lasted around 14.03 seconds, producing approximately 0.01467 kg of CO2 emissions and consuming 0.02143 kWh of energy. The operation similarly resulted in 0.00042 kg of steel waste.

5. **Fifth Event**: Finally, at 10:46:16 UTC, a split operation was conducted on SteelSheet[2375], weighing 0.02102 kg. This took 15.085 seconds, emitted 0.01577 kg of CO2, and consumed about 0.023 kWh of electricity, resulting once more in 0.00042 kg of steel waste designated for recycling.

Throughout all these operations, SteelCoil[3] played a crucial role in the production of various steel sheets, each reflecting the efficiency and environmental impact of the splitting process at Workstation[1].
