**Report on Events Related to o_workstation_1**

On April 3, 2023, multiple processing events occurred at Workstation[1] involving the machine identified as Splitter01 and the heating apparatus Machine[oven01], all related to steel sheets produced from SteelCoil[4], which has a mass of 31.91076 kg.

1. **Event 1**: At 09:54:24 UTC, Splitter01 split a steel sheet producing SteelSheet[675]. This process lasted approximately 14.32 seconds, resulting in carbon dioxide emissions of 0.01498 kg and generating 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling. The process consumed 0.02188 kWh of electricity from the grid.

2. **Event 2**: At 09:55:35 UTC, Machine[oven01] conducted a heating process on SteelSheet[676] at Workstation[1]. The heating lasted for 900 seconds, resulting in CO2 emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg. The energy consumed was recorded at 0.02 kWh, accompanied by a gas input of 0.49392 Wh, also with an emission of burn totaling 0.49392 Wh.

3. **Event 3**: At 09:55:48 UTC, Splitter01 split a steel sheet derived from SteelCoil[4], producing SteelSheet[681] weighing 0.02125 kg. The operation took approximately 13.99 seconds and emitted 0.014629305 kg of CO2, consuming 0.0213748 kWh of electricity and generating 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

4. **Event 4**: At 09:57:00 UTC, Splitter01 operated again at Workstation[1], splitting SteelSheet[686] from SteelCoil[4]. The process lasted about 14.36 seconds, resulting in emissions of roughly 0.015 kg of CO2 and consuming approximately 0.02194 kWh of electricity while producing another 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

5. **Event 5**: Finally, at 09:58:25 UTC, Splitter01 was utilized once more to split a steel sheet, creating SteelSheet[692] from SteelCoil[4]. This process lasted approximately 14.41 seconds, with carbon dioxide emissions of about 0.0151 kg and generating 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

Each of these processes illustrates the ongoing operations at Workstation[1] and the interrelation of the machines and steel sheets engaged in production and recycling activities throughout the described timeframe.
