On April 6, 2023, several important manufacturing events occurred, beginning at 09:20:14 UTC when a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_4892 and a mass of 0.02116 kg was processed at workstation ID o_workstation_1 using machine ID o_machine_former02. This transformation resulted in the creation of a formed part identified as o_formedpart_4892. The operation took 5.0 seconds, generating emissions of 0.0028500228 kg of CO2e and consuming 0.0041667 kWh of electric energy. 

Shortly after, at 09:29:14 UTC, another steel sheet, with a mass of 0.02118 kg, was used as input at the same workstation with the machine known as former02. This process also took 5 seconds to produce a formed part, though the ID and mass of this formed part were not specified. Similar to the earlier event, this operation generated a carbon dioxide equivalent emission of 0.0028500228 kg and consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electrical energy sourced from the grid.

Then, at 09:49:16 UTC, a cutting operation was performed at workstation 2 using machine cutter01, where input was taken from the formed part with ID formedpart_4764. This operation lasted approximately 9.96 seconds and resulted in the creation of a male part identified as malepart_4764. It produced 0.0687 kg of CO2 emissions, consumed 0.0152177 kWh of electricity, and utilized 0.066 m続 of compressed air along with 0.061 m続 of nitrogen gas, which was additionally emitted into the air.

At 09:56:18 UTC, a part identified as FormedPart[5041] underwent a coating process lasting 300 seconds at Workstation[1], using Machine[coater03]. This operation emitted 0.1751156951 kg of CO2, consumed 0.25 kWh of electrical energy from the grid, utilized 0.0004 kg of coating material, and generated 0.0001 kg of material waste.

Finally, at 09:56:56 UTC, another cutting operation took place involving a female part with ID FemalePart[4680] at Workstation[2] using Machine[cutter01]. This process lasted 12.381 seconds, generating 0.0834507326222 kg of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. It consumed 0.0189156 kWh of electricity, utilized 0.072 m続 of compressed air, and involved 0.076 m続 of nitrogen gas, with similar amounts emitted into the air. The operation resulted in 0.00253 kg of steel waste and produced a formed part identified as FormedPart[4680]. 

Overall, the day was marked by a series of processing and cutting operations, showcasing the interdependencies between materials and machinery involved in the production processes.
