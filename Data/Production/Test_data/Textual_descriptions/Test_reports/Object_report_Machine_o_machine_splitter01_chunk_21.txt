**Report for Object: o_machine_splitter01**

On April 5, 2023, the machine identified as **o_machine_splitter01** executed several splitting operations at **o_workstation_1**.

1. At **07:56:56 UTC**, the machine processed a steel coil, **o_steelcoil_2**, weighing **31.91076 kg**, to produce a steel sheet identified as **o_steelsheet_3125**, with a mass of **0.02114 kg**. The operation lasted **6.773 seconds**, resulting in **0.0070867686 kg** of CO2 emissions, consuming **0.0103477 kWh** of electric energy and generating **0.00042 kg** of steel waste earmarked for recycling.

2. At **08:12:06 UTC**, the machine again utilized **o_steelcoil_2** to create a new steel sheet identified as **o_steelsheet_3204**, weighing **0.0212 kg**. This operation lasted approximately **14.14 seconds**, resulting in **0.014785 kg** of CO2 emissions and consuming **0.0216029 kWh** of electricity. The activity also generated **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling.

3. At **08:23:01 UTC**, **o_machine_splitter01** split a steel coil weighing **31.91076 kg**, producing a steel sheet labeled **SteelSheet[3250]**, with a mass of **0.02122 kg**. The duration of this process was about **13.86 seconds**, emitting **0.01449 kg** of CO2 and consuming **0.0211719 kWh** of electricity. It also generated **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling.

4. At **08:32:05 UTC**, the process continued with the same machine at Workstation[1], processing the steel coil **SteelCoil[2]** to yield a steel sheet identified as **SteelSheet[3288]**. The operation lasted approximately **13.793 seconds** and resulted in **0.014422737 kg** of CO2 emissions while consuming **0.0210728 kWh** of electricity, along with **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling.

5. Finally, at **08:33:02 UTC**, **Machine[splitter01]** processed the same steel coil **SteelCoil[2]** to produce another steel sheet, **SteelSheet[3292]**, weighing **0.0213 kg**. This operation lasted about **14.90 seconds**, emitted approximately **0.016 kg** of CO2, consumed **0.0228 kWh** of electric energy, and generated **0.00042 kg** of steel waste intended for recycling.

In summary, the machine **o_machine_splitter01** demonstrated a consistent productive capacity throughout the day, converting steel coils into various steel sheets while maintaining a high level of efficiency and minimal waste.
