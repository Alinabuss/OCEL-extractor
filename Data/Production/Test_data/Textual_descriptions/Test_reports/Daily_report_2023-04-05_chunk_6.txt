On April 5, 2023, several significant events took place involving different machines and operations at various workstations.

At 10:51:23 UTC, a SteelSheet with an ID of o_steelsheet_3803, weighing 0.0213 kg, was processed in the FormSteelSheet operation, which lasted 5.0 seconds. This operation was executed by the Machine with ID o_machine_former02, located at Workstation with ID o_workstation_1. As a result, a FormedPart with ID o_formedpart_3803 was produced. The operation emitted 0.0028500228 kg of CO2e and consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electricity.

Shortly after, at 10:52:39 UTC, another steel sheet, identified as SteelSheet[3804] with a mass of 0.02126 kg, was also used in a similar process to create a formed part, resulting in FormedPart[3804]. This operation also lasted 5.0 seconds, used Machine[former02] at Workstation[1], and resulted in an emission of 0.0028500228 kg of CO2e, with a power consumption of approximately 0.0041667 kWh. The mass of the formed part remained unspecified.

At 10:57:00 UTC, a machine labeled as o_machine_cutter01, located at Workstation with ID o_workstation_2, processed a formed part with ID o_formedpart_3521 to create a male part identified as MalePart with ID o_malepart_3521. This cutting process lasted approximately 9.92 seconds, generating 0.0629 kg of CO2 equivalent. The operation consumed 0.0151 kWh of electricity, 0.052 m³ of compressed air, and 0.061 m³ of nitrogen gas. There was also 0.061 m³ of nitrogen gas emitted during this process, while the amount of steel waste generated remains unspecified.

Finally, at 10:57:49 UTC, a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_3828, weighing 0.02105 kg, was utilized as input for another operation at workstation o_workstation_1. Machine with ID o_machine_former02 was engaged to form a part identified as o_formedpart_3828. This operation, similar in duration to the earlier ones, took 5 seconds and resulted in a carbon dioxide equivalent emission of 0.0028500228 kg and an electricity consumption of 0.0041667 kWh. The formed part emerged as an output from the processed steel sheet. 

This report summarizes the events occurring throughout the day on April 5, 2023, highlighting the interactions between various machines, steel sheets, and formed parts.
