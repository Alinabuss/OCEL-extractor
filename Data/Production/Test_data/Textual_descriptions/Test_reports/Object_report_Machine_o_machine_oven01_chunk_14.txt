### Combined Report for Object o_machine_oven01

On April 4, 2023, the machine identified as o_machine_oven01 performed several heating processes at workstation o_workstation_1:

1. **Event 1**: At 12:08:43 UTC, o_machine_oven01 heated a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_2717. This process, labeled HeatSteelSheet, lasted for 900 seconds, resulting in emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg CO2 equivalent. Energy consumption included 0.02 kWh from the grid and a gas input of 0.49392 Wh, which also produced corresponding emissions from burning.

2. **Event 2**: At 12:13:09 UTC, the machine processed a different steel sheet, ID o_steelsheet_2736, for another 900 seconds, generating 0.0138019093344 kg CO2 equivalent emissions. The heating operation consumed 0.02 kWh of electrical energy and 0.49392 Wh of gas, accompanied by equivalent emissions from burning.

3. **Event 3**: At 12:22:52 UTC, o_machine_oven01 heated another steel sheet, ID o_steelsheet_2777, again for 900 seconds. During this event, CO2 emissions measured 0.0138019093344 kg, with energy consumption at 0.02 kWh from the grid and a gas input of 0.49392 Wh, resulting in additional emissions from burning.

4. **Event 4**: Later that day at 12:31:15 UTC, a heating operation was conducted on steel sheet ID o_steelsheet_2812 for the same duration of 900 seconds, which yielded the same emissions results: 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent, 0.02 kWh from the grid, and a gas input of 0.49392 Wh, leading to equivalent burn emissions.

The following day, on April 5, 2023, at 07:40:42 UTC, o_machine_oven01 processed yet another steel sheet, ID SteelSheet[2969], in a heating operation that once again lasted 900 seconds. This operation recorded similar consumption figures: 0.02 kWh from the grid, gas input of 0.49392 Wh, and emissions of approximately 0.0138019093344 kg CO2 equivalent alongside emissions from burning of 0.49392 Wh. 

All heating processes were conducted at workstation o_workstation_1 utilizing machine o_machine_oven01.
