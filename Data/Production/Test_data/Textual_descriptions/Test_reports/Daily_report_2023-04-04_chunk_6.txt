On April 4, 2023, several operations were carried out involving different machines and materials at designated workstations.

At 10:33:35 UTC, a machine identified as Machine[former02], situated at Workstation[1], processed a SteelSheet with ID SteelSheet[2249], weighing 0.02092 kg. This operation lasted 5.0 seconds, emitting 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 equivalent and consuming 0.0041667 kWh of electricity. The output of this process was a formed part designated as FormedPart[2249], created from the initial steel sheet.

Shortly after, at 10:39:39 UTC, a cutting process occurred at Workstation o_workstation_2, utilizing the machine o_machine_cutter01. During this operation, an input formed part with ID o_formedpart_1980 was processed, resulting in an output male part with ID o_malepart_1980. The cutting process took approximately 9.93 seconds, consuming 0.0151655 kWh of electricity, 0.052 cubic meters of compressed air, and 0.061 cubic meters of nitrogen gas, while emitting 0.0651788108889 kg of CO2. The amount of steel waste generated was unspecified.

Following this, at 10:42:11 UTC, another forming operation took place at o_workstation_1, also using the machine machine_former02. A steel sheet with a mass of 0.02106 kg served as input for this process, which lasted 5 seconds and resulted in the production of a formed part, mass unspecified. Similar to the previous operations, it emitted 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 equivalent and drew 0.0041667 kWh from the grid.

At 11:02:38 UTC, another forming process was initiated at Workstation[1] using the same machine, machine former02. This operation involved a steel sheet weighing 0.02108 kg and lasted for 5.0 seconds. It resulted in an emission of 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 equivalent and consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electricity, producing an unspecified formed part as output.

Finally, at 11:06:18 UTC, another steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[2388] and weighing 0.02104 kg was processed at Workstation[1], with the output being FormedPart[2388]. This forming operation, which took 5.0 seconds, emitted 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 and consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electricity. The machine involved was once again Machine[former02]. Upon completion, the formed part was produced, directly linked to the original steel sheet. 

Overall, the events on April 4, 2023, showcase the ongoing processing and forming of steel sheets into formed parts, utilizing both Machine[former02] and o_machine_cutter01 across multiple workstations.
