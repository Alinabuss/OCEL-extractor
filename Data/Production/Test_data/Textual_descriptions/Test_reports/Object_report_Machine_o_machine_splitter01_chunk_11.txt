**Report for o_machine_splitter01**

On April 4, 2023, the machine identified as o_machine_splitter01, located at Workstation 1 (ID: o_workstation_1), carried out several operations involving steel coils and sheets throughout the day.

1. **First Operation**: On April 4, 2023, at 07:49:19 UTC, o_machine_splitter01 processed a steel coil (ID: o_steelcoil_3) weighing 31.91076 kg. This splitting operation lasted 6.639 seconds, resulting in the creation of a steel sheet weighing 0.02116 kg. During this process, it emitted 0.006947 kg of CO2 equivalent, consumed 0.0101433 kWh of electricity, and generated 0.00042 kg of steel waste designated for recycling.

2. **Second Operation**: Shortly after, at 07:49:25 UTC, o_machine_splitter01 executed another splitting operation using the same steel coil (ID: o_steelcoil_3). This operation lasted approximately 6.76 seconds and produced a steel sheet (ID: o_steelsheet_1578) weighing 0.02111 kg. The process consumed 0.0103353 kWh of energy and resulted in CO2 emissions of 0.007078287 kg, alongside 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

3. **Third Operation**: At 07:52:18 UTC, o_machine_splitter01 processed a steel sheet (ID: SteelSheet[1604]) weighing 0.02117 kg. This activity took 6.55 seconds and resulted in CO2 emissions of 0.006855235 kg. The operation was powered by 0.0100092 kWh of electricity. The steel sheet was sourced from another steel coil (ID: SteelCoil[3], mass 31.91076 kg), with 0.00042 kg of steel waste intended for recycling.

4. **Fourth Operation**: Later, at 08:03:53 UTC, o_machine_splitter01 conducted a steel sheet splitting process that lasted approximately 14.004 seconds. During this operation, it created a new steel sheet (ID: o_steelsheet_1690) weighing 0.02113 kg. The machine consumed 0.0214 kWh of electricity and emitted 0.0146 kg of CO2. It continued using the steel coil (ID: o_steelcoil_3) weighing 31.9108 kg and produced 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

5. **Fifth Operation**: Finally, at 08:06:30 UTC, o_machine_splitter01 processed the steel coil (ID: SteelCoil[3]) again, leading to the creation of a steel sheet (ID: SteelSheet[1701]). This operation took 14.498 seconds, generated 0.0152 kg of CO2, and utilized 0.0222 kWh of electricity. The operation also resulted in 0.00042 kg of steel waste that was directed towards recycling.

Throughout these processes, the consistent usage of steel coil IDs (o_steelcoil_3 and SteelCoil[3]) and the creation of various steel sheets highlight the machine's operational efficiency and the environmental considerations, evidenced by CO2 emissions and waste recycling initiatives.
