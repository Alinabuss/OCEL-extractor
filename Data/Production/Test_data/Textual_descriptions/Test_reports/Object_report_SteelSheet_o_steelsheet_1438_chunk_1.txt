On April 3, 2023, at 12:55:45 UTC, a machine known as Splitter01, situated at Workstation 1, executed a splitting operation on the steel sheet identified as o_steelsheet_1438 (SteelSheet[1438]). This operation took approximately 14.25 seconds, leading to a carbon dioxide emission of 0.014905 kg. The process consumed 0.0217778 kilowatt-hours of electricity from the grid and generated 0.00042 kg of steel waste intended for recycling. The steel sheet was derived from a steel coil (SteelCoil[4]) with a mass of 31.91076 kg. The electric consumption during this operation reflects the ongoing energy usage associated with the machine at Workstation 1.
