On April 4, 2023, a series of production events took place, primarily involving the cutting of both female and male parts at different workstations.

At 12:01:04 UTC, a cutting process was conducted using the machine identified as o_machine_cutter01 at Workstation o_workstation_2. This operation lasted approximately 12.5 seconds and resulted in the production of a female part with ID o_femalepart_2288, which was derived from the formed part o_formedpart_2288. During this process, energy consumption amounted to 0.0190974 kWh, leading to CO2 emissions of 0.0835614038222 kg. Additionally, the operation utilized 0.072 cubic meters of compressed air and 0.076 cubic meters of nitrogen gas, which were also emitted to the air. The cutting process yielded minimal steel waste of 0.00254 kg.

Shortly thereafter, at 12:01:44 UTC, a steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[2619] and a mass of 0.02119 kg was processed using Machine[former02] at Workstation[1]. This operation lasted 5.0 seconds and resulted in the output formed part ID FormedPart[2619]. It consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electricity and produced CO2 emissions of 0.0028500228 kg.

At 12:01:49 UTC, the same machine, o_machine_cutter01, was utilized again at Workstation o_workstation_2 to cut a female part with ID FemalePart[2256]. This process took approximately 12.635 seconds and resulted in the output female part with ID FemalePart[2256]. The operation generated CO2 emissions of 0.0936704557778 kg while consuming 0.0193045 kWh of electricity, along with 0.097 m続 of compressed air and 0.077 m続 of nitrogen gas. It also produced steel waste amounting to 0.00257 kg. The formed part associated with this process is referenced as FormedPart[2256].

At 12:03:42 UTC, another cutting operation was conducted at Workstation o_workstation_2, involving a female part with ID o_femalepart_2251. This operation utilized the machine o_machine_cutter01 and lasted approximately 12.42 seconds, resulting in the creation of the formed part with ID o_formedpart_2251. The operation produced CO2 equivalent emissions of 0.090805 kg, consumed 0.0189676 kWh of electricity, 0.097 m続 of compressed air, and 0.076 m続 of nitrogen gas, which was emitted to the atmosphere. Additionally, small steel waste of 0.00253 kg was produced.

Lastly, at 12:07:17 UTC, a male part was cut at Workstation[2] using Machine[cutting01]. The process took approximately 9.90 seconds and resulted in the output of a male part with ID MalePart[2303] from the input formed part ID FormedPart[2303]. The operation consumed 0.0151281 kWh of electricity, along with 0.059 cubic meters of compressed air and 0.061 cubic meters of nitrogen gas, which were also emitted. The CO2 emissions recorded were 0.0682722692889 kg, alongside unspecified steel waste.

This day's operations showcased a structured workflow involving multiple machines and workstations, contributing to the overall production of both female and male parts efficiently.
