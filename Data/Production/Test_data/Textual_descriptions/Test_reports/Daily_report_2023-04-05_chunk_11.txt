On April 5, 2023, several significant production activities took place involving various machines and components at designated workstations. 

At 12:54:09 UTC, the machine identified as Machine[form02] was operated at Workstation[1] to produce a formed part from SteelSheet[4320], which had a mass of 0.02119 kg. This process lasted for 5 seconds, resulting in the successful creation of a formed part with unspecified mass. During this operation, CO2 emissions amounted to 0.0028500228 kg, and the total electric energy consumed was 0.0041667 kWh.

Shortly after, at 13:16:06 UTC, another steel sheet, SteelSheet[4413], weighing 0.02104 kg, was utilized in a forming operation to produce a part identified as FormedPart[4413]. This 5-second operation was again conducted at Workstation[1] using Machine[former02], resulting in a CO2 emission of 0.0028500228 kg and consuming 0.0041667 kWh of electricity.

Later, at 13:34:27 UTC, the machine identified as Cutter with ID o_machine_cutter01 was employed at Workstation[2] to cut a male part, o_malepart_4186. This cutting process produced a formed part identified as o_formedpart_4186 and lasted approximately 9.88 seconds, during which it emitted 0.0666 kg of CO2 equivalent. The operation also utilized 0.0151 kWh of electricity and required 0.055 m³ of compressed air along with 0.06 m³ of nitrogen gas, which was emitted back into the air.

Following this activity, at 13:36:19 UTC, the machine identified as cutter01 continued operations at Workstation[2]. This process took around 10.02 seconds and involved processing a formed part, generating 0.0711 kg of CO2e emissions and consuming approximately 0.0153 kWh from the grid. It also required 0.066 m³ of compressed air and 0.061 m³ of nitrogen gas, which was similarly emitted back into the air. This operation resulted in the creation of a male part.

Finally, at 13:44:57 UTC, Machine[cutter01] again operated at Workstation[2] to cut the formed part with ID FormedPart[4034]. This activity lasted approximately 10.09 seconds, consuming 0.0154087 kWh of electric energy and requiring 0.076 m³ of compressed air. Additionally, it utilized 0.062 m³ of nitrogen gas, which was emitted in equal volume. The outcome of this cutting operation was the production of MalePart[4034], with carbon dioxide emissions measured at 0.074 kg. The amount of steel waste generated during this process remains unspecified.

Overall, the activities on April 5, 2023, encapsulated a series of well-coordinated manufacturing processes across Workstation[1] and Workstation[2], showcasing the integration of various machines, materials, and energy usage in the production workflow.
