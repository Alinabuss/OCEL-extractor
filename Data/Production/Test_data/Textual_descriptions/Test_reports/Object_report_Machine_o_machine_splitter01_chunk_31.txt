**Report on Operations for Object o_machine_splitter01**

On April 6, 2023, multiple operations were performed using the machine identified as o_machine_splitter01 located at workstation Workstation[1]. 

1. **Event 1**: At 10:00:03 UTC, a steel sheet was split, resulting in the output SteelSheet[5134] weighing 0.02122 kg, produced from the steel coil SteelCoil[1], which had a mass of 31.91076 kg. This operation lasted approximately 15.02 seconds, emitting 0.0157 kg of CO2. Additionally, it generated 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling and consumed 0.0229427 kWh of electricity from the grid.

2. **Event 2**: At 10:00:59 UTC, another steel sheet was split, producing SteelSheet[o_steelsheet_5138] weighing 0.02115 kg from the same steel coil, SteelCoil[1]. This operation took around 14.57 seconds, resulted in emissions of 0.0152393646 kg of CO2, generated 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling, and consumed 0.0222667 kWh of electric energy from the grid.

3. **Event 3**: A subsequent operation occurred at 10:07:53 UTC, producing the output SteelSheet[5167] weighing 0.02116 kg and made from SteelCoil[1] within a duration of approximately 14.72 seconds. This event resulted in CO2 emissions of 0.01539 kg, generated 0.00042 kg of recyclable steel waste, and utilized approximately 0.02249 kWh of electricity from the grid.

4. **Event 4**: At 10:25:52 UTC, a further splitting event resulted in the creation of SteelSheet[5243] with a mass of 0.02139 kg from SteelCoil[1]. This operation lasted about 13.607 seconds, generated 0.014229 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions, consumed around 0.0207889 kWh of electric energy from the grid, and produced 0.00042 kg of recyclable steel waste.

5. **Event 5**: Finally, at 10:29:10 UTC, another operation was conducted, resulting in SteelSheet[5257] weighing 0.02106 kg from SteelCoil[1]. This operation lasted approximately 13.99 seconds, generated emissions of 0.01463 kg of CO2, consumed 0.02138 kWh from the grid, and produced 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

Throughout these events, the steel coil utilized was consistently SteelCoil[1] with a mass of 31.91076 kg, and the workstation involved remained Workstation[1].
