On April 4, 2023, multiple operations were carried out involving various machines and parts. 

The first event occurred at 13:20:44 UTC, where a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[2953], weighing 0.02114 kg, was utilized as input in a forming process at Workstation[1] using a machine with ID Machine[former02]. This process took 5.0 seconds to complete, consuming 0.0041667 kWh of electricity and resulting in the production of a formed part identified as FormedPart[2953]. The operation emitted approximately 0.0028500228 kg of CO2e.

Later, at 13:32:45 UTC, a cutting operation was performed with a machine identified as o_machine_cutter01 located at Workstation with ID o_workstation_2. This process lasted about 9.97 seconds, wherein a formed part with ID o_formedpart_2609 was processed, resulting in a newly generated male part identified as MalePart with ID o_malepart_2609. The operation consumed 0.0152335 kWh from the grid and generated 0.061 m³ of gas. Additionally, it required 0.078 m³ of compressed air and emitted a carbon footprint of 0.0741241628889 kg of CO2 equivalent. The exact mass of the MalePart and other material attributes were not recorded.

Following this, at 13:34:37 UTC, the same cutting machine (ID o_machine_cutter01) was again employed at o_workstation_2 for cutting a raw male part identified as o_malepart_2514. This operation lasted approximately 9.98 seconds and resulted in the production of a formed part identified as o_formedpart_2514. The process emitted 0.068 kg of CO2e and consumed 0.01525 kWh of electricity, along with the utilization of 0.06 m³ of compressed air and 0.061 m³ of nitrogen gas, which was also emitted during the operation. Data on the mass of both the male and formed parts were recorded as unknown.

At 13:45:16 UTC, another cutting operation was carried out where a formed part with ID FormedPart[2708] was cut from a female part identified as FemalePart[2708]. This procedure, executed using a machine labeled Machine[cutter01] at Workstation[2], took 12.5521361436 seconds and resulted in the production of 0.00252 kg of steel waste. The operation consumed about 0.0191769 kWh of electricity, along with 0.074 m³ of compressed air and 0.077 m³ of nitrogen gas, which was also emitted into the environment. The emission of this event amounted to 0.0836651773778 kg of CO2.

Lastly, at 13:45:39 UTC, another cutting operation took place involving a female part with ID FemalePart[2837]. This operation, which lasted approximately 12.6 seconds, emitted 0.0854 kg of carbon dioxide equivalent and required 0.0192 kWh of electric energy from the grid. It also consumed 0.078 m³ of compressed air and 0.077 m³ of nitrogen gas, with equivalent emissions recorded. The formed part resulting from this action was identified as FormedPart[2837], also processed at Workstation[2].

Thus, on April 4, 2023, a series of interconnected manufacturing operations were performed, involving multiple objects and contributing to emissions and energy consumption metrics.
