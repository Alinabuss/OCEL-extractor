**Report for Object o_machine_oven01**

On April 6, 2023, the machine identified as o_machine_oven01, located at workstation o_workstation_1, facilitated multiple heating processes for various steel sheets throughout the day.

1. The first heating event occurred at 08:02:52 UTC for a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_4636, weighing 0.02114 kg. This operation lasted for 900 seconds and resulted in a carbon dioxide equivalent emission of 0.0138019093344 kg. During this period, the process consumed 0.02 kWh of electricity from the grid and 0.49392 Wh of gas input, which also contributed to emissions of 0.49392 Wh.

2. Shortly after, at 08:15:41 UTC, another steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_4690, weighing 0.02121 kg, underwent a similar heating process for 900 seconds. This event produced the same CO2 equivalent emission of 0.0138019093344 kg, with an electricity consumption from the grid amounting to 0.02 kWh and gas input of 0.49392 Wh, matching the emissions from burning.

3. The third heating event took place at 08:17:18 UTC for another steel sheet, ID o_steelsheet_4697, with a mass of 0.02119 kg. This process lasted 900 seconds and recorded identical emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2, consuming 0.02 kWh of electricity and 0.49392 Wh of gas, resulting in the same level of gas emissions.

4. Following this, at 08:18:16 UTC, a heating procedure was performed for the steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[4701], which had a mass of 0.02116 kg. The operation again lasted for 900 seconds, yielding a CO2 emission of 0.0138019093344 kg. The electric consumption from the grid was consistent at 0.02 kWh, with a gas input of 0.49392 Wh leading to matching emissions.

5. Lastly, at 08:26:37 UTC, the machine processed a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_4736, weighing 0.02137 kg. This heating lasted 900 seconds, resulting in a carbon dioxide equivalent emission of 0.0138019093344 kg. During this event, the electric consumption remained at 0.02 kWh, accompanied by a gas input of 0.49392 Wh, which also caused emissions of 0.49392 Wh.

Throughout these events, the processes consistently involved similar durations, emissions, and energy consumptions. Each steel sheet was processed efficiently by the same machine at the specified workstation.
