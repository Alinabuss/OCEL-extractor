**Combined Report for Workstation o_workstation_1**

On April 4, 2023, Workstation[1] was active in several processes involving steel sheets created from steel coils. 

1. **First Operation**: At 11:12:07 UTC, the machine identified as Machine[splitter01] operated at Workstation[1]. It processed SteelCoil[3], weighing 31.91076 kg, resulting in the creation of SteelSheet[2484], which has a mass of 0.02125 kg. This task took approximately 14.239 seconds, consuming 0.0217542 kWh of electricity from the grid, and produced a CO2 equivalent emission of 0.0148888146 kg, along with 0.00042 kg of steel waste designated for recycling.

2. **Second Operation**: Shortly after, at 11:13:18 UTC, a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_2489, having a mass of 0.02132 kg, was also created from the same steel coil (ID o_steelcoil_3, mass 31.91076 kg) using the machine o_machine_splitter01 at Workstation[1]. This process lasted approximately 14.08 seconds and produced 0.014725407 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions, using 0.0215153 kWh of electricity from the grid, along with 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

3. **Heating Processes**: 
   - At 11:14:15 UTC, a heating process was initiated on steel sheet o_steelsheet_2489 (0.02132 kg) using oven machine o_machine_oven01 at Workstation[1]. This operation lasted for 900 seconds, with emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent, consuming 0.02 kWh of electricity and 0.49392 watt-hours of gas input. 
   - In another heating process at 11:14:41 UTC, the heating of another steel sheet, o_steelsheet_2491 (0.02114 kg), was also conducted using the same oven at Workstation[1]. This process also lasted for 900 seconds, resulting in emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent, consuming 0.02 kWh of electricity and 0.49392 watt-hours of gas input.
   - Finally, at 11:21:51 UTC, steel sheet SteelSheet[2521], weighing 0.0211 kg, underwent a similar heating process lasting 900 seconds using Machine[oven01] at Workstation[1]. This operation produced 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 emissions, while also utilizing 0.02 kWh of electricity and 0.49392 watt-hours of gas.

Overall, all processes conducted at Workstation[1] adhered to the use of grid-supplied electrical energy and resulted in significant emissions and waste suitable for recycling.
