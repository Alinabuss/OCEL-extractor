**Report for Object: o_machine_splitter01**

On April 5, 2023, the machine identified as o_machine_splitter01 operated multiple times at workstation ID o_workstation_1, engaged in the process of splitting steel sheets from a steel coil identified as o_steelcoil_2, which weighed approximately 31.91076 kg.

1. The first operation occurred at **10:27:35 UTC**. The machine split a steel sheet that resulted in SteelSheet[3774], weighing 0.02105 kg. The splitting lasted **13.788 seconds**, emitting **0.014417607 kg** of CO2 and generating **0.00042 kg** of steel waste for recycling, while consuming **0.0210653 kWh** of electricity.

2. Later, at **10:40:08 UTC**, the machine performed another splitting task, generating SteelSheet[3827] weighing 0.02122 kg. This operation took approximately **14.125 seconds**, during which **0.0147700722 kg** of CO2 equivalent was emitted and **0.00042 kg** of steel waste was produced. The energy consumed from the grid was **0.0215806 kWh**.

3. At **10:45:19 UTC**, the machine was utilized again, resulting in another steel sheet weighing 0.02122 kg, with the splitting taking approximately **13.87 seconds**. Emissions were recorded at **0.01450 kg** of CO2 and **0.00042 kg** of steel waste was generated for recycling. The energy usage during this operation was approximately **0.02119 kWh**.

4. The fourth event took place at **10:51:43 UTC**, where the output was SteelSheet[o_steelsheet_3876], weighing about 0.02125 kg. This process lasted around **14.48 seconds**, generating approximately **0.015 kg** of CO2 emissions and utilizing roughly **0.022 kWh** of electricity from the grid while producing **0.00042 kg** of steel waste.

5. Finally, at **10:57:40 UTC**, the machine created SteelSheet[o_steelsheet_3901], weighing 0.02132 kg. This operation lasted **14.265 seconds**, emitting **0.014916243 kg** of CO2. It also drew **0.0217943 kWh** of electricity and produced an additional **0.00042 kg** of steel waste.

All operations consistently utilized the same steel coil, and the outputs generated were notable both for their weight and the emissions produced during the splitting processes.
