On April 4, 2023, at 12:24:05 UTC, a SteelCoil with ID o_steelcoil_3 and a mass of 31.91076 kg was utilized to create a SteelSheet identified as o_steelsheet_2786, which has a mass of 0.02124 kg. This event occurred during the process of splitting the steel sheet, executed by the machine identified as o_machine_splitter01. The splitting operation lasted 13.9505415346 seconds and generated an emission of 0.014587239 kg of CO2 equivalents. The operation took place at Workstation o_workstation_1, which is powered by electric energy sourced from the grid. During the process, the workstation consumed 0.0213133 kWh of electricity and produced a minimal amount of 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling. The SteelSheet was specifically created from the SteelCoil, highlighting the relationship between these two objects.
