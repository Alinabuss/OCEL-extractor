On April 3, 2023, several significant manufacturing processes took place, each utilizing different formed parts and machines.

At 10:55:38 UTC, a coating process occurred involving a formed part identified as o_formedpart_855. This part was coated using the machine labeled o_machine_coater03, located at workstation o_workstation_1. The coating lasted for 300 seconds, resulting in a carbon dioxide equivalent emission of 0.1751156951 kg. Energy consumption from the grid was measured at 0.25 kWh, with the process utilizing 0.0004 kg of coating material and generating 0.0001 kg of coating material waste.

Shortly after, at 11:02:58 UTC, another coating process took place involving a formed part identified as o_formedpart_890. This process used the same machine, o_machine_coater03, and occurred at the same workstation, o_workstation_1, with a duration of 300 seconds. It also produced a carbon dioxide equivalent emission of 0.1751156951 kg, consumed 0.25 kWh of grid energy, and utilized 0.0004 kg of coating material while creating 0.0001 kg of coating material waste.

Following these coating operations, at 11:04:42 UTC, a female part, identified as o_femalepart_482, was processed during a cutting operation designated as CuttFemalePart. This operation utilized the machine labeled o_machine_cutter01 at workstation o_workstation_2. The input for this process was a formed part, o_formedpart_482, and lasted approximately 12.59 seconds, producing the output female part o_femalepart_482. During this operation, energy consumption from the grid was recorded at 0.01924 kWh, along with the use of 0.103 cubic meters of compressed air and 0.077 cubic meters of nitrogen gas. Additionally, 0.00253 kg of steel waste was generated, and the carbon dioxide equivalent was measured at 0.09699 kg.

At 11:04:43 UTC, a forming operation took place where a steel sheet, identified as o_steelsheet_901 and weighing 0.02133 kg, was transformed into a formed part with the ID o_formedpart_901. This operation utilized the machine labeled o_machine_former02 at workstation o_workstation_1 and lasted for 5 seconds, producing an emission of 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 and consuming 0.0041667 kWh of electricity from the grid.

Finally, at 11:05:04 UTC, another cutting operation for a female part was performed using a machine identified as Cutter01 at workstation o_workstation_2. This operation lasted approximately 12.54 seconds and produced 0.00255 kg of steel waste. It also resulted in the emission of 0.077 m³ of nitrogen gas into the atmosphere and consumed 0.0191587 kWh of electricity, alongside 0.085 m³ of compressed air and 0.077 m³ of nitrogen gas. The formed part involved in this operation was identified as FemalePart 552.

Overall, these events from April 3, 2023, demonstrate a series of interconnected manufacturing processes involving various machines and formed parts, marked by specific emissions and energy usage metrics.
