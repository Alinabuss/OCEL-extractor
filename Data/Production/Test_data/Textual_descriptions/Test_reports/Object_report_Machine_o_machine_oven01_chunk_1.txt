**Report Summary for Machine ID: o_machine_oven01**

On April 3, 2023, machine o_machine_oven01, located at workstation o_workstation_1, conducted multiple heating processes for various steel sheets. 

1. At 07:50:39 UTC, a heating process for steel sheet ID o_steelsheet_99 (mass: 0.02123 kg) was initiated. The operation, known as HeatSteelSheet, lasted for 900 seconds and produced an emission of 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent. Energy consumption during this operation included 0.02 kWh from the electric grid and 0.49392 Wh from gas input, leading to equivalent emissions from burning.

2. At 08:05:16 UTC, the machine heated steel sheet ID o_steelsheet_211 (mass: 0.02126 kg) for an identical duration of 900 seconds, generating the same CO2 emission of 0.0138019093344 kg. This process also utilized 0.02 kWh from the grid and had a gas input of 0.49392 Wh, resulting in the same burning emissions.

3. At 08:14:49 UTC, another heating process was performed on steel sheet ID o_steelsheet_251 (mass: 0.02129 kg) for 900 seconds, attaining the same CO2 emission output of 0.0138019093344 kg. Similar to previous operations, it required 0.02 kWh from the grid and had a gas input of 0.49392 Wh, with corresponding emissions from burning.

4. At 08:34:02 UTC, the machine heated steel sheet ID o_steelsheet_332 (mass: 0.0212 kg) for 900 seconds, again producing CO2 emissions of 0.0138019093344 kg. The energy breakdown consisted of 0.02 kWh from the grid and 0.49392 Wh of gas input, resulting in burn emissions of the same amount.

5. Lastly, at 08:36:25 UTC, the heating process for steel sheet ID o_steelsheet_342 (mass: 0.02152 kg) was completed. This treatment lasted for 900 seconds, generating CO2 emissions of approximately 0.0138019093344 kg, with energy inputs mirroring the previous processes: 0.02 kWh from the grid and 0.49392 Wh from gas, carrying similar burning emissions.

Each heating operation lasted 900 seconds and demonstrated consistent energy utilization and emissions across all processes.
