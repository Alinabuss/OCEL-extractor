On April 3, 2023, several operations were conducted across different workstations, detailing the production and processing of various metal parts.

At 10:13:08 UTC, a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_679 and a mass of 0.02137 kg was utilized as input in a forming process at workstation ID o_workstation_1. The machine employed, identified as o_machine_former02, produced a formed part with ID o_formedpart_679 over a span of 5.0 seconds. This operation emitted 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 equivalent and consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electricity from the grid.

Following this, at 10:14:33 UTC, a female part was processed using a machine cutter at workstation 2. Though the mass of the input female part and the created formed part was not specified, the cutting operation lasted approximately 12.56 seconds, consuming 0.01919 kWh of electricity from the grid and 0.066 m³ of compressed air. Additionally, 0.077 m³ of nitrogen gas was utilized, with the same volume emitted into the air, while also generating 0.00253 kg of steel waste and producing 0.0815 kg of CO2 equivalent.

Shortly thereafter, at 10:14:45 UTC, another cutting operation occurred at workstation ID o_workstation_2, resulting in the production of male part ID o_malepart_227 from formed part ID o_formedpart_227. This process, which lasted approximately 10.01 seconds, consumed 0.0153 kWh of electricity, 0.077 m³ of compressed air, and 0.061 m³ of nitrogen gas. It emitted 0.061 m³ of nitrogen into the atmosphere and resulted in a CO2 equivalent emission of 0.0733 kg. The machine used for this operation was identified as o_machine_cutter01.

The activities continued at 10:15:35 UTC with a coating operation on formed part ID o_formedpart_689, performed by machine o_machine_coater03 at workstation ID o_workstation_1. This activity lasted for 300 seconds, consuming 0.25 kWh of electricity, generating 0.1751156951 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions, and utilizing 0.0004 kg of coating material while producing 0.0001 kg of coating material waste.

Lastly, at 10:19:06 UTC, another coating process was carried out on formed part ID FormedPart[702] at workstation ID Workstation[1] using machine ID coater03. This coating also extended over 300 seconds, resulting in approximately 0.175 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions. The process mirrored the previous one by consuming 0.25 kWh of electricity and employing 0.0004 kg of coating material, with a minimal waste output of 0.0001 kg. 

Overall, April 3, 2023, witnessed a series of interconnected operations involving various parts, machinery, and emissions throughout the metal forming and coating processes.
