On April 6, 2023, several manufacturing operations were carried out, detailed as follows.

At 12:27:37 UTC, a cutting operation was executed using the machine identified as cutter01 at workstation 2. This process involved cutting a male part with ID malepart_5374, which was originally sourced from a formed part with ID formedpart_5374. The cutting operation took approximately 9.98 seconds and emitted 0.06999 kg of CO2e. During this time, it consumed 0.0152525 kWh of electricity, 0.065 m³ of compressed air, and 0.061 m³ of N2 gas, while additionally releasing 0.061 m³ of N2 gas into the air. The resulting output of this activity was the male part with ID malepart_5374.

Shortly thereafter, at 12:30:33 UTC, a coating process began at workstation identified as o_workstation_1, using machine ID o_machine_coater03. This operation coated the formed part with ID o_formedpart_5694, which had an unspecified mass, and lasted for 300 seconds. The process emitted 0.1751156951 kg of CO2e, consumed 0.25 kWh of energy from the grid, and used 0.0004 kg of coating material, producing a coating material waste of 0.0001 kg.

At 12:33:33 UTC, a machining operation took place at o_workstation_1, where a steel sheet identified as o_steelsheet_5707, weighing 0.02134 kg, was transformed into a formed part with ID o_formedpart_5707. The machining lasted 5.0 seconds, generated 0.0028500228 kg of CO2e, and utilized 0.0041667 kWh of electrical energy, facilitated by the machine ID o_machine_former02.

Following this, at 12:38:40 UTC, a cutting operation for a female part occurred, utilizing the machine with ID o_machine_cutter01 at workstation ID o_workstation_2. This process transformed the formed part with ID o_formedpart_5373 into the resulting female part with ID o_femalepart_5373. The cutting took approximately 12.56 seconds, emitting 0.08451 kg of CO2e, while consuming 0.01919 kWh of energy, 0.075 m³ of compressed air, and 0.077 m³ of nitrogen gas, which was also released into the air. The operation produced 0.00255 kg of steel waste.

Finally, at 12:42:48 UTC, another processing action occurred whereby a steel sheet weighing 0.02125 kg was utilized. The machine identified as Machine[former02] at Workstation[1] used 0.0041667 kWh of electric energy during an operation that lasted 5.0 seconds. This process resulted in the creation of the formed part designated as FormedPart[5747], with emissions of 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 equivalent and clear relationships between the input steel sheet, the machine, and the output formed part.
