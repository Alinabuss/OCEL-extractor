On April 3, 2023, a series of notable operations were conducted across various workstations. 

At 11:11:18 UTC, Machine[form_02] processed a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[927] at Workstation[1]. This FormSteelSheet operation lasted for 5.0 seconds, producing 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 emissions and consuming 0.0041667 kWh of electricity. The steel sheet had a mass of 0.02121 kg, resulting in a formed part labeled as FormedPart[927].

Subsequently, at 11:19:21 UTC, a cutting operation occurred involving a formed part with ID o_formedpart_603 at Workstation[o_workstation_2]. This operation produced a female part with ID o_femalepart_603, taking approximately 12.496 seconds. It generated 0.0868 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions and consumed 0.0190906 kWh of electricity. Additionally, 0.08 cubic meters of compressed air and 0.076 cubic meters of nitrogen gas were utilized, alongside the generation of 0.00254 kg of steel waste.

At 11:22:13 UTC, another heating process took place at Workstation[1], where Machine[oven01] heated a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[1041]. This operation lasted for 900 seconds, emitting 0.0138019093344 kg of CO2 equivalent, consuming 0.02 kWh of electricity and 0.49392 Wh of gas input, which caused an equivalent emission of CO2.

Following this, at 11:27:04 UTC, a cutting operation for a MalePart occurred at Workstation[2]. During this operation, Machine[cutter01] was employed and it produced a formed part denoted as FormedPart[609]. The process lasted approximately 9.975 seconds and resulted in an emission of 0.0703462940889 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions. The operation involved the consumption of 0.0152403 kWh of electricity, along with 0.06 m続 of compressed air and 0.061 m続 of nitrogen gas.

Finally, at 11:28:34 UTC, another male part was cut at Workstation[2]. This process, utilizing Machine[Machine_cutter01], lasted roughly 9.95 seconds and generated 0.0702 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions. The recorded energy consumption was 0.0152 kWh from the grid, with 0.071 m続 of compressed air and 0.061 m続 of nitrogen gas consumed, matching the emission levels of nitrogen gas. The output from this operation was the male part identified as MalePart[793], created from the supplied formed part labeled as FormedPart[793]. 

Overall, April 3, 2023, involved a series of interconnected processing and cutting activities, resulting in various emissions and the creation of multiple formed parts essential for production.
