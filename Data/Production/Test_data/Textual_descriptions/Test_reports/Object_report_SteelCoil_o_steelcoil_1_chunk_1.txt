**Report on Object o_steelcoil_1**

On April 6, 2023, a series of processing events were conducted on the steel coil identified as SteelCoil[1], which has a mass of 31.91076 kg.

1. **Event at 07:40:02 UTC**: A machine known as Splitter01 located at Workstation[1] processed the steel coil, resulting in the creation of a steel sheet labeled SteelSheet[4447], which weighed 0.02106 kg. The splitting operation had a duration of 6.6228 seconds, during which it emitted 0.0069298 kg of CO2 equivalent, consumed 0.0101182 kWh of electricity, and produced 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling.

2. **Event at 07:43:35 UTC**: Following the initial operation, the same machine, referred to as "machine_splitter01", again processed the steel coil. This time, the output was a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_4479, weighing 0.0213 kg. The process lasted approximately 6.69 seconds, generating 0.007003 kg of CO2 equivalent and consuming 0.0102252 kWh of electricity. It also produced 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling, establishing a direct link between the steel coil and the produced steel sheet.

3. **Event at 07:59:48 UTC**: Another operation by Machine[splitter01] at Workstation[1] processed the same steel coil, resulting in a new steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[4626]. This activity lasted around 6.666 seconds and emitted 0.006975 kg of CO2 equivalent while consuming approximately 0.0101843 kWh of electricity. The mass of the resultant steel sheet was recorded at 0.02105 kg.

4. **Event at 08:23:59 UTC**: Later in the day, another splitting event occurred using the same splitter machine at Workstation[1]. This operation produced a new steel sheet with ID 4729 from SteelCoil[1], lasting approximately 14.586 seconds. The machine emitted 0.015251 kg of CO2, consumed 0.0222844 kWh of electricity, and generated 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling. The mass of the newly created steel sheet was 0.02121 kg.

5. **Event at 08:24:43 UTC**: Shortly after, Splitter01 again processed SteelCoil[1], producing a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[4732]. This process lasted 13.7751 seconds, during which the machine emitted 0.014404 kg of CO2, used 0.0210453 kWh of electricity, and generated 0.00042 kg of steel waste intended for recycling. The steel sheet weighed 0.02121 kg, reinforcing its association with the original steel coil.

Throughout these operations, the steel coil SteelCoil[1] consistently served as the input, leading to the creation of multiple steel sheets while involving various emissions and energy consumptions.
