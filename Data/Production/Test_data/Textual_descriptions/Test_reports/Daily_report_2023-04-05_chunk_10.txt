On April 5, 2023, several operations were performed across different workstations resulting in the creation of formed parts and associated emissions.

At 12:00:17 UTC, a cutting operation occurred with Machine[cutting01] at Workstation[2], where a male part identified as MalePart[3649] was cut. This operation took approximately 10.04 seconds, leading to the formation of FormedPart[3649]. The energy consumption was recorded at 0.015 kWh, and it utilized 0.077 cubic meters of compressed air, while emitting 0.061 cubic meters of nitrogen gas and producing 0.0749 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions. Additionally, there was unspecified steel waste generated.

Shortly after, at 12:02:32 UTC, the cutting machine designated as Machine[cutter01] was again utilized at Workstation[2] for cutting MalePart[3785]. This operation lasted around 9.996 seconds, leading to the creation of FormedPart[3785]. It consumed 0.0152722 kWh of electricity, used 0.073 cubic meters of compressed air, and involved both the utilization and emission of 0.061 cubic meters of nitrogen gas. The CO2 emissions were recorded at 0.073 kg, and there was also some unspecified steel waste generated during this process.

Next, at 12:09:26 UTC, a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[4133] weighing 0.0212 kg was processed by Machine[former02] at Workstation[1]. This operation, which lasted 5 seconds, resulted in the creation of FormedPart[4133] and emitted 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 during the process. The energy consumption was 0.0041667 kWh.

Later, at 12:25:24 UTC, another cutting operation was done with a machine identified as o_machine_cutter01 at Workstation with ID o_workstation_2. This operation produced MalePart with ID o_malepart_3920 from FormedPart with ID o_formedpart_3920, lasting approximately 10 seconds. During the process, it consumed 0.0153293 kWh of electricity, used 0.078 m³ of compressed air, and involved the utilization and emission of 0.061 m³ of nitrogen gas, all while emitting 0.0757286900889 kg of CO2 equivalent. Unspecified steel waste was again generated.

Finally, at 12:53:06 UTC, another steel sheet with a mass of 0.0212 kg was processed at Workstation[1] using Machine[former02]. This operation, which lasted for 5.0 seconds, resulted in the creation of FormedPart[4315], while emitting 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 equivalent and consuming 0.0041667 kWh of electrical energy from the grid.

This summary encapsulates all relevant events from April 5, 2023, detailing the activities, involved machines, parts created, and emissions associated with each operation.
