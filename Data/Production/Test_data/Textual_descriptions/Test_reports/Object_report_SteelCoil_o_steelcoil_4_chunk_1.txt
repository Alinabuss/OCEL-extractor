**Summary Report for Object o_steelcoil_4**

On April 3, 2023, the machine identified as Machine[splitter01] (ID: o_machine_splitter01), located at Workstation[1] (ID: o_workstation_1), conducted a series of splitting operations on the steel coil with ID SteelCoil[o_steelcoil_4], which has a mass of 31.91076 kg.

1. The first operation occurred at 07:55:26 UTC, lasting approximately 6.76 seconds. This resulted in the creation of SteelSheet[151], weighing 0.021 kg. The operation generated 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling, emitted 0.0070691214 kg of CO2 equivalent, and consumed 0.0103219 kWh of electricity.

2. A second operation took place at 07:56:39 UTC, with a duration of about 6.624 seconds, generating SteelSheet[o_steelsheet_162] with a mass of 0.02112 kg. This process produced 0.00042 kg of steel waste, emitted 0.0069312954 kg of CO2, and consumed 0.0101204 kWh of electricity.

3. Following these, at 08:11:15 UTC, another splitting operation was executed, lasting approximately 14.36 seconds. This resulted in the creation of SteelSheet[o_steelsheet_240] which weighed 0.021 kg. The operation emitted 0.015 kg of CO2, consumed 0.0219376 kWh of electricity, and produced an additional 0.00042 kg of steel waste.

4. At 08:19:34 UTC, a further operation was conducted which lasted around 14.14 seconds, creating a steel sheet weighing 0.02108 kg. The associated emissions were 0.01478 kg of CO2, with an electricity usage of 0.0216 kWh and steel waste generated of approximately 0.00042 kg.

5. Lastly, on that same day at 08:20:32 UTC, a final operation was performed taking about 14.31 seconds, leading to the creation of SteelSheet[o_steelsheet_279] with a mass of 0.02117 kg. This process emitted around 0.015 kg of CO2, consumed about 0.0219 kWh of electricity, and generated 0.00042 kg of steel waste.

Throughout these operations, the relationship between the machine, workstation, and steel coil o_steelcoil_4 was consistently maintained, demonstrating the efficient processing in multiple instances.
