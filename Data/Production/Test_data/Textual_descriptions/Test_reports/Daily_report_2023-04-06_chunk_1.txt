On April 6, 2023, a series of events occurred at Workstation with ID "o_workstation_1," where the machine identified as "o_machine_former02" was actively engaged in forming steel sheets into formed parts.

At 08:03:11 UTC, the process began with a steel sheet identified by ID "o_steelsheet_4505," having a mass of 0.02095 kg. This operation lasted for 5.0 seconds and produced a formed part with ID "o_formedpart_4505." Throughout this procedure, the machine consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electricity from the grid and emitted approximately 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 equivalent. 

Shortly afterward, at 08:06:57 UTC, another steel sheet, SteelSheet[4534] with a mass of 0.02129 kg, was processed in a similar manner, resulting in a formed part identified as FormedPart[4534]. This forming process also took 5 seconds, consuming the same amount of electrical energy (0.0041667 kWh) and emitting 0.0028500228 kg of CO2.

At 08:16:23 UTC, yet another steel sheet weighing 0.02107 kg was processed at workstation 1. This operation, which lasted for 5 seconds, resulted in a formed part with an unspecified mass. The energy consumption was consistent at 0.0041667 kWh, alongside CO2 emissions of approximately 0.0028500228 kg.

Later, at 08:37:31 UTC, the workstation was once again utilized to form a steel sheet weighing 0.02124 kg. This process, which lasted for 5 seconds, produced a formed part represented by ID "o_formedpart_4716." Like the previous operations, the energy used was recorded at 0.0041667 kWh, and CO2 emissions stood at 0.0028500228 kg.

Finally, at 08:40:01 UTC, the machine "o_machine_former02" was involved yet again, this time transforming a steel sheet identified as "o_steelsheet_4726" with a mass of 0.02115 kg into a formed part labeled "o_formedpart_4726." This forming operation lasted for 5.0 seconds, maintaining the same energy consumption of 0.0041667 kWh and CO2 emissions of 0.0028500228 kg.

Throughout these processes on April 6, 2023, the relationships between input steel sheets and output formed parts were clearly established, with consistent energy consumption and emissions recorded during each operation at Workstation "o_workstation_1."
