**Report on Heating Processes for Object o_machine_oven01**

On April 5, 2023, machine o_machine_oven01, located at workstation o_workstation_1, conducted several heating processes for various steel sheets.

1. At **11:20:11 UTC**, a heating operation was performed for steel sheet ID **o_steelsheet_3992**, which has a mass of **0.02128 kg**. This process lasted for **900 seconds**, emitting **0.013802 kg** of CO2 equivalents. The energy consumption was recorded at **0.02 kWh** from the grid, with a gas input of **0.49392 Wh**.

2. Subsequently, at **11:21:22 UTC**, another heating process took place for steel sheet ID **o_steelsheet_3997**, weighing **0.02125 kg**. The operation shared the same duration of **900 seconds** and emissions totaling **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2 equivalents, with the same energy consumption of **0.02 kWh** and gas input of **0.49392 Wh**.

3. At **11:34:13 UTC**, machine o_machine_oven01 processed steel sheet ID **o_steelsheet_4051**, which had a mass of **0.02115 kg**. This heating operation, also lasting **900 seconds**, recorded emissions of **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2 equivalents, alongside energy consumption of **0.02 kWh** and gas input of **0.49392 Wh**.

4. The next heating operation occurred at **11:56:00 UTC** for steel sheet ID **o_steelsheet_4143**, weighing **0.02109 kg**. This process lasted **900 seconds** and emitted **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2 equivalents, while using **0.02 kWh** of electricity and **0.49392 Wh** of gas input.

5. Finally, at **12:00:15 UTC**, steel sheet ID **o_steelsheet_4161**, which has a mass of **0.02135 kg**, underwent heating. This operation continued for **900 seconds**, yielding CO2 equivalent emissions of **0.0138019093344 kg**, with an electricity consumption of **0.02 kWh** and gas input of **0.49392 Wh**.

Throughout these processes, machine o_machine_oven01 efficiently conducted heating tasks for various steel sheets with consistent energy consumption and emission levels at workstation o_workstation_1.
