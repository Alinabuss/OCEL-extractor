**Report for Object o_steelcoil_4**

On April 3, 2023, a series of operations involving the steel coil with ID SteelCoil[4] were conducted at Workstation[1] utilizing the machine known as Machine[splitter01]. 

1. **First Operation**: 
   - **Timestamp**: 13:00:32 UTC
   - **Event**: A splitting operation resulted in the creation of a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[1458].
   - **Mass of Steel Coil**: 31.91076 kg (SteelCoil[4])
   - **Output**: The operation produced 0.02099 kg of steel sheet, 0.01436 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions, and generated 0.00042 kg of steel waste, which was designated for recycling.
   - **Duration**: Approximately 13.73 seconds.

2. **Second Operation**: 
   - **Timestamp**: 13:03:36 UTC
   - **Event**: Another processing of the steel coil (o_steelcoil_4) led to the creation of steel sheet o_steelsheet_1471.
   - **Output**: The steel sheet weighed 0.02103 kg, and the operation resulted in 0.0152590638 kg of CO2 emissions and 0.00042 kg of steel waste earmarked for recycling.
   - **Duration**: Approximately 14.593 seconds.

3. **Third Operation**: 
   - **Timestamp**: 13:05:01 UTC
   - **Event**: A further splitting operation again involved the SteelCoil[4], leading to the creation of SteelSheet[1477].
   - **Output**: This process generated 0.01506 kg of CO2 emissions, 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling, and consumed 0.02201 kWh of electricity.
   - **Duration**: Approximately 14.41 seconds.

Throughout these operations, the steel coil served as a critical input, leading to the production of several steel sheets and generating emissions alongside minimal waste, all tracked at Workstation[1].
