On April 6, 2023, at 10:56:40 UTC, the machine Machine[splitter01] operated at Workstation[1] to split the steel coil SteelCoil[1], resulting in the creation of SteelSheet[5373]. The splitting process lasted approximately 14.2 seconds, during which the machine consumed 0.0216987 kWh of electricity from the grid and emitted 0.014851 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions. The processed steel coil had a mass of 31.91076 kg, while the resulting steel sheet, SteelSheet[5373], had a mass of 0.02123 kg. Additionally, the process generated a negligible amount of steel waste, measuring 0.00042 kg, intended for recycling.
