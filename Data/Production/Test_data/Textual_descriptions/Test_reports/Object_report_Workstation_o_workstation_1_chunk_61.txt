### Combined Report for Object o_workstation_1

On April 6, 2023, a series of operations were conducted at workstation identified as o_workstation_1.

1. At **11:28:48 UTC**, a steel coil with ID **o_steelcoil_1**, weighing **31.91076 kg**, was utilized in a process where the machine **o_machine_splitter01** performed a split on a steel sheet with ID **o_steelsheet_5508** (weight **0.02121 kg**). The splitting operation lasted approximately **14.395 seconds**, generating **0.0150518118 kg** of CO2 emissions and consuming **0.0219925 kWh** of electricity. Additionally, **0.00042 kg** of steel waste, designated for recycling, was produced from this process.

2. Shortly after, at **11:30:40 UTC**, a heating operation took place involving a steel sheet with ID **SteelSheet[5512]**, weighing **0.02095 kg**. This heating process, carried out by machine **Machine[oven01]** at the same workstation, lasted **900 seconds** and resulted in **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2 equivalent emissions. The operation consumed **0.02 kWh** of electricity and used **0.49392 Wh** of gas input, which correlated with the emissions from burning.

3. The next heating operation occurred at **11:31:25 UTC**, involving a steel sheet with ID **SteelSheet[5515]**, weighing **0.02089 kg**. Conducted by **Machine[oven01]** for **900 seconds**, this process emitted **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2 equivalent, utilized **0.02 kWh** from the grid, and consumed **0.49392 Wh** of gas input.

4. Just seconds later, at **11:31:38 UTC**, another heating operation was carried out for a steel sheet with ID **SteelSheet[5516]** (mass **0.02116 kg**) using **Machine[oven01]**. This process also lasted **900 seconds**, yielding **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2 equivalent emissions, with energy consumption from the grid recorded at **0.02 kWh**, and gas input alongside emissions from burning noted at **0.49392 Wh** each.

5. Finally, at **11:35:29 UTC**, the heating process commenced for a steel sheet with ID **o_steelsheet_5532**, weighing **0.02109 kg**. The operation also utilized **Machine[oven01]** at workstation **o_workstation_1**, lasting **900 seconds** and resulting in **0.0138019093344 kg** of CO2 equivalent emissions. This process consumed **0.02 kWh** from the grid and utilized **0.49392 Wh** for gas input and emissions from burning.

In summary, on this date, multiple operations involving various steel sheets were completed at workstation o_workstation_1, utilizing both a splitter and an oven for processing, while generating CO2 emissions and consuming electrical and gas energy throughout the series of tasks.
