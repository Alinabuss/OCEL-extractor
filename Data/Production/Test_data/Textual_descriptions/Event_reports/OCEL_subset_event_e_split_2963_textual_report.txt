On April 5, 2023, at 07:39:00 UTC, a process took place where a machine identified as "machine_splitter01," located at workstation "o_workstation_1," initiated the splitting of a steel sheet. The operation utilized steel coil "o_steelcoil_2" and resulted in the creation of steel sheet "o_steelsheet_2963." The duration of this splitting action was approximately 6.43 seconds, during which the process generated 0.00673 kg of CO2 emissions and produced 0.00042 kg of steel waste intended for recycling. The electrical consumption from the grid during this task was about 0.00982 kWh, collectively indicating the environmental and resource impact of the activity. The steel coil involved had a mass of 31.91076 kg, while the resulting steel sheet had a mass of 0.02103 kg.
