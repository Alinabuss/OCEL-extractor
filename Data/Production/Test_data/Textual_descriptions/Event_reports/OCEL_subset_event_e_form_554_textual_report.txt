A machine located at Workstation with ID o_workstation_1 and operating at an electric consumption level of o_workstation_1 performed the operation of forming a steel sheet on April 3, 2023, at 09:42:14 UTC. During this operation, which lasted for 5.0 seconds, a steel sheet with a mass of 0.02117 kg was processed to create a formed part identified as o_formedpart_554. The process emitted approximately 0.0028500228 kg of CO2 and consumed 0.0041667 kWh of electricity from the grid. The formed part was outputted from the machine with ID o_machine_former02, which is designated to operate with an electric consumption specification of (Pointer-M-electr-former02). The formed part resulted from the input of the steel sheet identified as o_steelsheet_554.
