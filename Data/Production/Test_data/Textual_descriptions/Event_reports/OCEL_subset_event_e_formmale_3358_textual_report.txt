On April 5, 2023, at 10:11:32 UTC, a process involving the cutting of a male part was conducted. The operation lasted approximately 10.04 seconds and was performed at workstation 2, utilizing machine cutter 01. During this procedure, the resulting male part, identified as MalePart[3358], was produced from the input formed part, labeled FormedPart[3358]. The machine consumed 0.01533 kWh of electricity and produced 0.069 cubic meters of compressed air. Additionally, 0.061 cubic meters of gas-nitrogen were used, and an equivalent volume was emitted into the air. The operation resulted in a carbon dioxide equivalent emission of 0.07016 kg. Data regarding the mass of the formed part and male part remains unspecified, and steel waste production was also not quantified.
