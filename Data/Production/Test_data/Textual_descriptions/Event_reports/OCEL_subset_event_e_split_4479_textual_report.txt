On April 6, 2023, at 07:43:35 UTC, a machine known as "machine_splitter01" located at the workstation began a process to split steel sheets. This operation lasted approximately 6.69 seconds and produced a steel sheet labeled with ID "o_steelsheet_4479", which had a mass of 0.0213 kg. During this process, it consumed 0.0102252 kWh of electricity from the grid and generated 0.00042 kg of steel waste for recycling, while emitting 0.0070029786 kg of CO2 equivalent. The input for this splitting operation was a steel coil identified as "o_steelcoil_1", which has a mass of 31.91076 kg. The steel sheet created was directly derived from this steel coil, establishing a clear relationship between them.
