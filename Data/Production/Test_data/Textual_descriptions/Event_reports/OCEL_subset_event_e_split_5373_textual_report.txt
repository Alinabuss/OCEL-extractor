On April 6, 2023, at 10:56:40 UTC, the machine named Machine[splitter01] operated at Workstation[1] to split a steel sheet, resulting in a output SteelSheet[5373] that was created from SteelCoil[1]. This splitting process took approximately 14.2 seconds and produced 0.014851 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions. During this process, the machine consumed 0.0216987 kWh of electricity from the grid and generated a negligible steel waste of 0.00042 kg to recycle. The steel coil that was processed had a mass of 31.91076 kg while the resulting steel sheet had a mass of 0.02123 kg.
