On April 3, 2023, at 09:30:17 UTC, a cutting operation for a female part took place, consuming approximately 0.019 kWh of electricity and resulting in 0.0839 kg of CO2 emissions. The process lasted about 12.45 seconds. During this operation, the machine designated as Machine[1] was utilized. The input for this action was a formed part identified as FormedPart[22], which subsequently led to the creation of a female part labeled FemalePart[22]. This operation occurred within the confines of Workstation[2]. Additionally, there were minor emissions involving 0.078 m³ of compressed air and 0.076 m³ of nitrogen gas used, with an equivalent amount also emitted to the air. Furthermore, the cutting process generated a negligible amount of waste steel, quantified at 0.00253 kg.
