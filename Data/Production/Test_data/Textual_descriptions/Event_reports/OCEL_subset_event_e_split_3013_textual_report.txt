The process began on April 5, 2023, at 07:44:33 UTC, when the machine named Splitter01 carried out the task of splitting a steel sheet. This operation lasted approximately 6.48 seconds and took place at Workstation 1. During the process, a steel coil with the ID SteelCoil[2] was utilized and a steel sheet, labeled SteelSheet[3013] was produced as an output of the operation. The machine used, identified as Machine[Splitter01], is located at Workstation 1, and it contributed an input of approximately 0.0099 kWh of electric energy from the grid, while also generating a CO2 equivalent emission of about 0.0068 kg. Additionally, a small amount of steel waste, weighing about 0.00042 kg, was created for recycling. The steel coil had a mass of 31.91 kg, and the newly created steel sheet had a weight of 0.02122 kg.
