A male part was produced by a machine cutter located at workstation 2 on April 6, 2023, at 14:29:11 UTC. The duration of the cutting process was approximately 9.91 seconds. During this time, the operations consumed about 0.015 kWh of electric energy from the grid, 0.05 cubic meters of compressed air, and 0.061 cubic meters of nitrogen gas, which was also emitted into the air. The process generated an estimated carbon dioxide equivalent of 0.064 kg. The male part, identified as MalePart[5552], was created from an input formed part identified as FormedPart[5552]. In terms of waste, the amount of steel waste produced was unspecified. The machine involved in this operation, identified as Machine[cutter01], drew its power from the workstation and was associated with the energy consumption metrics reported.
