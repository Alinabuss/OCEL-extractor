On April 6, 2023, at 09:18:35 UTC, the machine identified as Machine[splitter01] was involved in the process of splitting a steel sheet. This operation, known as the SplitSteelSheet process, lasted for approximately 14.63 seconds and produced an output steel sheet with ID SteelSheet[4959], which has a mass of 0.02106 kg. The process also involved a steel coil with ID SteelCoil[1], having a mass of 31.91076 kg, from which the output steel sheet was created. During this operation, energy consumption from the grid was recorded at 0.0223526 kWh, and the carbon emissions associated with the process were measured at 0.0152981202 kg CO2e. Additionally, a minimal amount of 0.00042 kg of steel waste was generated for recycling. The operation occurred at Workstation[1], where the machine is located.
