On April 6, 2023, at 08:33:41 UTC, a machine identified as Machine[splitter01] executed a splitting operation on SteelCoil[1] to produce SteelSheet[4770]. This operation lasted for approximately 14.89 seconds and generated a carbon dioxide equivalent of 0.01557 kg. During this process, the machine consumed 0.02276 kWh of electricity from the grid and produced a negligible amount of steel waste, specifically 0.00042 kg. The newly created SteelSheet[4770] is associated with the original SteelCoil[1], confirming that it was produced from this material. The splitting took place at Workstation[1], where the machine is located.
