On April 5, 2023, at 12:25:24 UTC, a machine identified as "o_machine_splitter01" was used to split a steel sheet at the workstation classified as "o_workstation_1". This operation generated a new steel sheet, designated as "o_steelsheet_4271", created from the steel coil referred to as "o_steelcoil_2", which weighs approximately 31.91076 kg. The split process lasted for about 14.54 seconds and resulted in an output that included steel with a mass of about 0.02106 kg and generated a CO2 equivalent of approximately 0.0152 kg. During this process, it consumed approximately 0.0222 kWh of electricity sourced from the grid and produced a minimal amount of steel waste, weighing around 0.00042 kg as recyclable material.
