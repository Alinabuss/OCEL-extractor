On April 4, 2023, at 10:58:36 UTC, a heating process was initiated on a steel sheet with ID o_steelsheet_2423 using the machine identified as o_machine_oven01 at the workstation labeled o_workstation_1. The heating process lasted for 900 seconds and resulted in a carbon dioxide equivalent emission of 0.0138019093344 kg. During this period, the power consumption from the grid was recorded at 0.02 kWh, with a gas input of 0.49392 Wh, resulting in the same amount of emissions from the burn process. The workstation, o_workstation_1, was specifically designated for this heating process, demonstrating its function in the operational workflow.
