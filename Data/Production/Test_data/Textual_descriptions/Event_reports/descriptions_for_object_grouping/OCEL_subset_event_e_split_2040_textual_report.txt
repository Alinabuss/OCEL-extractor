At 09:26:56 UTC on April 4, 2023, a workstation with the ID Workstation[1] located at Machine[Splitter01] initiated the splitting process of a steel sheet with an ID of SteelSheet[2040]. This operation lasted for approximately 13.61 seconds and produced a steel sheet weighing 0.02124 kg. The process utilized a steel coil with an ID of SteelCoil[3], which has a mass of 31.91076 kg. During this activity, 0.0207966 kWh of electrical energy was consumed, resulting in a carbon dioxide equivalent emission of 0.0142338162 kg and generating a negligible waste of steel amounting to 0.00042 kg to be recycled. The steel sheet produced was directly linked as an output of this process.
