On April 4, 2023, at 09:56:05 UTC, a machine identified as Machine[Splitter01] processed a SteelCoil with ID SteelCoil[3], leading to the creation of a SteelSheet with ID SteelSheet[2163]. This operation was performed at Workstation[1], which was located at the specified workstation. The splitting process took approximately 14.502 seconds and resulted in a carbon dioxide equivalent emission of 0.01516 kg. During this process, 0.022156 kWh of electricity was consumed from the grid, and a negligible amount of steel waste, specifically 0.00042 kg, was generated for recycling. The SteelSheet[2163] was created from the SteelCoil[3], confirming the direct relationship between these objects.
