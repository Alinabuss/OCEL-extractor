On April 5, 2023, at 10:02:25 UTC, a process for splitting a steel sheet was conducted at a workstation equipped with ID Workstation[1]. During this operation, a steel coil identified as SteelCoil[2] was used. The machine responsible for this task, Machine[splitter01], was located at the same workstation. The output of this process was a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet[3668]. The operation lasted for approximately 14.35 seconds and resulted in a carbon dioxide equivalent emission of 0.015 kg. The energy consumption during this process amounted to about 0.0219 kWh, while a minimal waste of 0.00042 kg of steel was generated for recycling. The steel coil that served as the initial material had a mass of 31.91076 kg, and the resulting steel sheet had a mass of 0.0212 kg.
