A machine identified as Splitter01, located at Workstation 1, performed a splitting operation on a steel sheet on April 3, 2023, at 12:55:45 UTC. This task took approximately 14.25 seconds and resulted in a carbon dioxide emission of 0.014905 kg. During the operation, the process consumed 0.0217778 kilowatt-hours of electricity from the grid and generated 0.00042 kg of steel waste intended for recycling. The steel sheet, with an ID of SteelSheet[1438], was created from a steel coil with a mass of 31.91076 kg, identified as SteelCoil[4]. The electric consumption from the grid associated with Workstation 1 at that time is noted, reflecting the ongoing energy usage of the machine.
