A machine identified as machine_splitter01, located at workstation_1, operated on April 6, 2023, at 09:35:39 UTC to perform the splitting of a steel sheet. This process took approximately 13.90 seconds and produced a steel sheet with an ID of steelsheet_5031 weighing 0.02096 kg. Throughout this operation, the machine consumed approximately 0.02124 kWh of electricity from the grid and generated around 0.01454 kg of CO2 emissions. Additionally, 0.00042 kg of steel waste was produced to be recycled. The operation utilized a steel coil (steelcoil_1) which had a total mass of 31.91076 kg. The steel sheet created from this coil highlights the direct relationship between these two objects, confirming that the steel sheet was produced from the steel coil during the split operation.
