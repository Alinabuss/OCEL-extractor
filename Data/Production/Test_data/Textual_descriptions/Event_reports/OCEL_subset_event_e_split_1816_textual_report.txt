A workstation identified as Workstation[1] processed a steel coil labeled SteelCoil[3], which weighs 31.91076 kg. This occurred on April 4, 2023, at 08:33:52 UTC when a splitting operation of a steel sheet, known as SteelSheet[1816], weighing 0.02121 kg, was initiated. The task took approximately 14.53 seconds to complete and resulted in a carbon dioxide equivalent emission of 0.0152 kg. During this process, the workstation operated with an energy consumption from the grid of 0.0222057 kWh and generated a negligible amount of steel waste, specifically 0.00042 kg, that was designated for recycling. The steel sheet produced was directly created from the initial steel coil. The machine utilized for the splitting operation is referred to as Machine[splitter01], located at the same workstation.
