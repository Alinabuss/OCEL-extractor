On April 3, 2023, at 12:07:17 UTC, a machine identified as cutter01 operated to cut a male part, generating the male part with ID malepart_986 as output. During this process, which lasted approximately 9.99 seconds, the machine utilized the formed part with ID formedpart_986 as input. The process resulted in an emission of 0.0645 kg of CO2 and the consumption of 0.0153 kWh of electricity, 0.056 m³ of compressed air, and 0.061 m³ of nitrogen gas. Additionally, 0.061 m³ of nitrogen gas was emitted into the air, while the amount of steel waste produced remains unspecified. The machine was located at workstation_2 and its electrical consumption from the grid is recorded as (Pointer-M-electr-cutter01).
