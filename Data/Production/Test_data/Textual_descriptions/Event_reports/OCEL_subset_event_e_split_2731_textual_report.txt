On April 4, 2023, at 12:10:59 UTC, a machine known as Splitter01 operated at workstation 1 to split a steel coil, which had a mass of 31.91076 kg. This process resulted in the creation of a steel sheet identified as SteelSheet2731, weighing 0.02107 kg. The splitting took approximately 14.59978 seconds and generated an output of 0.0152656986 kg of CO2 equivalent. During this operation, the machine consumed 0.0223052 kWh of electricity from the grid and produced a minimal amount of 0.00042 kg of steel waste destined for recycling. This steel sheet was created specifically from the aforementioned steel coil, demonstrating the relationships between these objects in the manufacturing process.
