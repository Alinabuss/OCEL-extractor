  55.��The �rights of defence�, of which Article 6 ��3 (b) gives a nonexhaustive list, have been instituted, above all, to establish equality, as far as possible, between the prosecution and the defence. The facilities which must be granted to the accused are restricted to those which assist or may assist him or her in the preparation of the defence (see Mayzit, cited above, ��79).

  56.��Article 6 ��3 (b) implies that the substantive defence activity on behalf of an accused may comprise everything which is �necessary� to prepare the main trial. The accused must have the opportunity to organise his defence in an appropriate way and without restriction as to the ability to put all relevant defence arguments before the trial court and thus to influence the outcome of the proceedings
