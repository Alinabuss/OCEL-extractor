(b) Application of the above principles to the present case

  60.��The issue to be determined in the instant case is whether the manner in which the proceedings were conducted in relation to the applicant guaranteed him effective enjoyment of the right to a fair hearing and enabled him to exercise his defence rights and to effectively participate in the proceedings.

  61.��The Court observes at the outset that the applicant�s lawyers raised on multiple occasions the issue of the applicant�s mental health condition, mainly in order to request the discontinuation of the proceedings on that ground (see paragraphs 13, 14, 20-22 and 26 above)
