  70.��The Court is therefore not persuaded that the steps taken by the national judicial authorities to ensure that the criminal proceedings against the applicant were in compliance with the requirements set forth in Article�6 ���1 and 3 of the Convention were insufficient: they ensured that the applicant was represented by a lawyer at every stage of the proceedings; they requested two forensic reports to verify whether the applicant understood the charges and the scope of the criminal proceedings, and examined the additional reports submitted by the applicant; and they made sure that the applicant was able to exercise his right to remain silent, without drawing any adverse inferences.
