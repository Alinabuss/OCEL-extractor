Moreover, under the new regulations (see paragraph 5 above), it will be necessary to consider who is responsible for determining a defendantï¿½s capacity or lack thereof (even if partial). In a case where a forensic doctor carries out an examination of the defendant and gives an opinion that certain additional or special measures are required in order to assist the defendant (as happened in the present case), judges are not obliged to follow it.
