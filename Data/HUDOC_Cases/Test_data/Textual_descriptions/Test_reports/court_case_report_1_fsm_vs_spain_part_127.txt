  62.��The Court sees no reason to depart from the domestic court�s conclusions concerning the possible discontinuation of the proceedings on account of the applicant�s mental health condition. It observes in this regard that none of the various forensic reports analysing the applicant�s situation found him unfit to stand trial or unable to understand the scope and purpose of the proceedings (see paragraphs 13, 16, 20 and 25).
