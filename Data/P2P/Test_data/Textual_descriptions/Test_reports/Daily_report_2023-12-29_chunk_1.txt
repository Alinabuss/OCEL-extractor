On December 29, 2023, several significant events occurred. At 05:02:00 UTC, a purchase order with the ID purchase_order:1074, affiliated with the Purchasing Group 001, was approved by the Procurement Order Manager, effectively completing its lifecycle. This approval was directly associated with a quotation, identified as quotation:625, also part of Purchasing Group 001.

Later that day, at 08:10:00 UTC, the Finance/Account Department successfully completed a two-way match between an invoice receipt and a goods receipt. The invoice receipt, with ID invoice receipt:1291 and a credit amount of 27,000.0, was matched with the goods receipt, ID goods receipt:1296, which is categorized under movement type 101.

Additionally, the same two-way match process was recorded as complete at this time, involving the Finance/Account Department again. The invoice receipt ID invoice receipt:1291, reflecting the credit amount of 27,000.0, was confirmed to have been matched not only with goods receipt ID goods receipt:1296 but also with another goods receipt identified as goods receipt:1295, which also belonged to movement type 101. This highlights a thorough scrutiny and validation process by the Finance/Account Department on the same date.
