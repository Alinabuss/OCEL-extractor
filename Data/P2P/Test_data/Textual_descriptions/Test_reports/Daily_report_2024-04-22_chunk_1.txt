On April 22, 2024, several key events occurred in relation to a goods receipt and an invoice receipt. 

At 03:12:00 UTC, a goods receipt was created with the ID goods receipt:1541. This goods receipt marked the completion of its process and was identified as having a lifecycle status of "complete." The creation of this receipt was managed by the Warehouse Department and was associated with a purchase order identified as purchase_order:1260, belonging to the purchasing group "001." Additionally, the recorded movement type for this goods receipt was "101."

Later on the same day, at 08:35:00 UTC, an invoice receipt was created, identified as invoice receipt:1539. This invoice reflected a credit amount of 27250.0 and was directly related to the previously mentioned goods receipt (goods receipt:1541). Similar to the goods receipt, the lifecycle of this invoice receipt was also marked as complete, and it was processed through the Finance/Account Department.

Shortly thereafter, at 08:45:00 UTC, the Finance/Account Department completed a two-way match involving the same goods receipt (goods receipt:1541) and the invoice receipt (invoice receipt:1539). This matching process confirmed the connection between the goods and the invoice, consolidating the details of the financial transaction for that day.
