On June 3, 2024, several significant events occurred related to procurement activities. At 10:10:00 UTC, the Procurement Order Manager completed the approval of the purchase order with ID purchase_order:1363. This purchase order was associated with the purchasing group labeled as 001 and was linked to the quotation having the ID quotation:790, which also belonged to the same purchasing group.

Later that day, at 21:36:00 UTC, the Procurement Department created a complete request for quotation, involving a purchase requisition designated by ID purchase_requisition:807:pr_trigger_807 and a quotation with ID quotation:804. Both the purchase requisition and the quotation were attributed to the purchasing group identified as "003." Notably, the quotation with ID quotation:804 was explicitly linked as the quotation for the corresponding purchase requisition, thereby establishing a clear relationship between these objects.
