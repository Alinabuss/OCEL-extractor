On October 4, 2022, the Warehouse Department initiated the creation of a goods receipt with the ID goods receipt:406 at 07:15:00 UTC, marking its lifecycle as complete. This goods receipt was associated with a purchase order labeled purchase_order:344, which was part of the purchasing group identified as 003, and was categorized under movement type 101.

Later that same day, at 15:12:00 UTC, the Warehouse Department completed the goods receipt with ID goods receipt:406, which was also linked to a different purchase order identified as purchase_order:343, maintaining the same purchasing group designation of 003 and the same movement type of 101. It is important to note that the relationship between the goods receipt and the purchase orders delineates the specific connections for the transactions, despite the overlap in group and movement type.
