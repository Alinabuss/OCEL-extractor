On September 27, 2022, the Finance/Account Department created a complete invoice receipt with ID invoice receipt:376 at 03:19:00 UTC. This invoice receipt had a credit amount of 47,350.0 and was linked to a goods receipt with ID goods receipt:356, which had a movement type of 101. Later that same day, at 07:13:00 UTC, the finance department completed the creation of the same invoice receipt, reinforcing its credit amount of 47,350.0. However, it was noted that this completion was associated with a different goods receipt, identified as goods receipt:358, which also had a movement type of 101. Thus, invoice receipt:376 is connected to both goods receipt:356 and goods receipt:358.
