On January 8, 2024, two significant events occurred in the Finance/Account Department. The first event took place at 09:08:00 UTC, when a two-way match was performed, resulting in completion. This process involved a goods receipt with ID 1326, which had a movement type of 101, and an invoice receipt with ID 1327, associated with a credit amount of 84,500.0.

Later in the day, at 16:25:00 UTC, the invoice receipt with ID 1327, reflecting the same credit amount of 84,500.0, was officially created, completing its lifecycle. Notably, this invoice receipt was connected to another goods receipt with ID 1324, which also had a movement type of 101, thereby establishing a clear relationship between these objects in the records.
