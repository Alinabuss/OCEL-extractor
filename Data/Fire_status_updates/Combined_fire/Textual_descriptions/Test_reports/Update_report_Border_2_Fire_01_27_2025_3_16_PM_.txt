Border 2 Fire as of 01/27/2025 at 3:16 PM:
Continued rain showers have brought over a half inch of rain across much of the fire area and has greatly reduced fire potential. Minimal fire activity and smoldering was seen overnight. Ground crews will continue to patrol fire lines and mop up hot spots. Crews will also be working to screen for suppression repair needs and making repair efforts a high priority.
