Border 2 Fire as of 01/24/2025 at 7:58 PM:
The fire is making uphill runs, influenced by shifting winds. Short-range spotting continues and fire fuels are very receptive to ignition. Very low humidity will continue overnight, but there is a possibility of rain over the fire area from Saturday night into Monday. Bull dozers and hand crews will continue to work overnight establishing containment lines, supported from the air by water dropping helicopters.
