Border 2 Fire as of 01/26/2025 at 4:12 PM:
Rainfall overnight and into the morning hours has led to a substantial decrease in fire activity. While not ending the possibility of fires in the long term, the saturation of grass and other light, flashy fuels will lessen the threat of the spread of the Border 2 Fire. Fire crews continue working in very steep terrain to cut containment line directly on the fire's edge, and dozers and engine crews, where able to make access, are cutting line and putting out any hot spots. The San Diego County Sheriff's Office encourages all residents to check the Genasys Protect evacuation map (linked below) for the latest updates to evacuation orders and warnings.
