Hughes Fire as of 01/23/2025 at 8:35 AM:
Overnight firefighters, with support from aircraft and dozers, fought aggressively and were challenged by extreme fire behavior, terrain, and weather. The coordinated ground and air attack kept the fire from spreading to Elderberry Canyon, the Castaic Hydroelectric Power Plant and surrounding communities. Eight Modular Airborne Firefighting Systems (MAFFS) launched from Channel Islands, flying a combined 11.1 hours and dropping 30,678 gallons of retardant. Two CAL FIRE HAWKS from the Prado Helitack Base flew 5.1 and 4.4 hours, respectively, delivering nearly 80,000 gallons of water. Another CAL FIRE HAWK from Hemet-Ryan Helitack Base operated overnight, flying 5 hours and dropping over 33,000 gallons of water.Today, crews will continue focusing on establishing and holding control lines on all flanks of the fire. Firefighters will continue reinforcing control lines and holding the fire in its current footprint, protecting the Wayside Honor Rancho and structures along Charlie Canyon drainage. Additional fire engines will be staged within the community of Castaic to prevent any fire spread. A red flag warning remains in effect for the area until 10:00 a.m. Friday. A high wind warning is in effect until 6:00 p.m. Thursday. Today firefighters expect extreme fire behavior and will continue to aggressively fight the blaze day and night with support from aircraft.
