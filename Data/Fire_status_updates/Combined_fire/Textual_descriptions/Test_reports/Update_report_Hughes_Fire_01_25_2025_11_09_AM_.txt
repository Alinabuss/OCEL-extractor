Hughes Fire as of 01/25/2025 at 11:09 AM:
Firefighters continued to improve and add control lines overnight, bringing containment to 87% and keeping the fire within its current perimeter. On the northern flank, crews patrolled rugged terrain for hot spots and will continue mop-up activities today. With yesterday’s evacuation orders lifted and residents returning to their homes, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department exited unified command. Additionally, the Red Cross closed their evacuation center for this fire, due to the rapid rate of containment and repopulation. We will begin releasing firefighters and resources to make them available for future incidents, should they be needed.Cooler temperatures and higher humidity tonight are expected to aid in the firefighters’ efforts in extinguishing hot spots. Crews will be on alert for localized flooding and debris flows this weekend, with the potential for rain in the forecast.
