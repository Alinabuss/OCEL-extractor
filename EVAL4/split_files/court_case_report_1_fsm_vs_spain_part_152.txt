 �If mental disturbance occurs after the offence has been committed, once the summary proceedings have been concluded, the competent court shall order the case to be discontinued until the defendant is restored to health, and the provisions of the Criminal Code shall also apply to the defendant as prescribed for those who commit an offence in a state of mental disturbance�.

  In addition, this provision is only relevant where it is considered that a defendant suffering from a mental disturbance may recover, and criminal proceedings may be resumed. Nothing is said about the situation where there is no possibility of a defendant�s recovery, for instance, where a defendant is suffering from Alzheimer�s disease or dementia2
