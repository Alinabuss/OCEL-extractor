  Article 706-113 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure requires that the curator or guardian be informed of the existence of the proceedings. This obligation to inform also requires that the agent be notified of the hearing date (Crim. 14 Apr. 2010, no. 09-83.503), failing which it will be null and void. The judgment that ignores this obligation to provide information when it has not been effective is subject to cassation (Crim. 6 June 2023, no. 23-81.726)
