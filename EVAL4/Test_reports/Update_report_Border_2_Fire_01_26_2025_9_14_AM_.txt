Border 2 Fire as of 01/26/2025 at 9:14 AM:
Substantial firefighting efforts have decreased fire spread. Due to remote wilderness locations and steep terrains, hand crews will continue ongoing fire line construction while being supported by helicopter water drops. Rain is expected to continue on and off today which will help mitigate fire activity.
